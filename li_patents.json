        "description": "PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF CRYSTALLINE FORM G OF \n FEBUXOSTAT \n Field of the Invention \n Provided herein is a process for the preparation of crystalline Form G of febuxostat. \n Background of the Invention \n Febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor known from U.S. Patent No. 5,614,520. It is chemically 2-[3-cyano-4-(2-methylpropoxy)phenyl]-4-methylthiazole-5-carboxylic acid, having the structure as represented by Formula I. \n\n     \n Formula I \n U.S. Patent No. 6,225,474 discloses processes for the preparation of the crystalline Form G of febuxostat using a mixed solvent of methanol and water having a volume ratio of methanol to water of 50:50, or by using a mixed solvent of 2-propanol and water having a volume ratio of 2-propanol to water of from about 90: 10 to 50:50. \n PCT Publication No. WO 201 1/141933 discloses a process for the preparation of the crystalline Form G of febuxostat using acetone and water. \n Japanese Publication No. JP 2003261548 discloses a process for the preparation of the crystalline Form G of febuxostat using a mixed solvent of methanol and water having a volume ratio of methanol to water of 70:30. \n U.S. Patent No. 7,361,676 discloses milling for reducing the particle size of the crystalline Form A of febuxostat. \n As per the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines for residual solvents in the pharmaceutical products, in order to protect patients from the \n\n potential adverse effects due to the inherent toxicity associated with methanol (a Class 2 residual solvent), its amount needs to be limited in the pharmaceutical products. \n Further, the presence of genotoxic impurities in a pharmaceutical product is considered to be a serious risk factor due to their potential to damage DNA at any level of exposure which may lead to, or contribute towards, tumor development. Thus, as per the ICH guidelines on the limit of genotoxic impurities in pharmaceutical products, there is a need to control the genotoxic impurities to the lowest possible level in pharmaceutical products. \n The particle size of an active pharmaceutical ingredient is also an important aspect that affects the bioavailability of the drugs. For drugs having poor aqueous solubility, e.g., febuxostat, it is desirable that the active pharmaceutical ingredient should have small particle size. A general method for reducing the particle size of an active pharmaceutical ingredient involves carrying out micronization of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. However, carrying out micronization of the active pharmaceutical ingredient sometimes results in agglomeration of the smaller particles to form larger particles, thereby reducing the solubility and bioavailability of the drug. Additionally, since greater energy input is required for carrying out micronization, it sometimes also causes instability and discoloration of the drug substance. Reducing the particle size of the active \npharmaceutical ingredient by micronization also increases the cost of the manufacturing process due to an increase in the manufacturing time and the requirement of additional process controls. \n Thus, there exists a need in the art for the development of an eco-friendly, cost- effective, and industrially advantageous process for the preparation of crystalline Form G of febuxostat that involves the use of a lesser amount of methanol as compared to the amount of water, controls the formation of genotoxic impurities, and avoids the need for reducing the particle size by carrying out micronization. \n Summary of the Invention \n The present invention provides an eco-friendly, cost-effective, and industrially advantageous process for the preparation of crystalline Form G of febuxostat. The process of the present invention involves the use of a mixed solvent of methanol and water having a volume ratio of methanol to water from 5:95 to 45:55. Crystalline form G of febuxostat, obtained by the process of the present invention, is substantially free of genotoxic \n\n impurities, ethyl 2-[3-cyano-4-(2-methylpropoxy)phenyl]-4-methyl- 1 ,3-thiazole-5- carboxylate (hereinafter referred to as \\\"the febuxostat ethyl ester impurity\\\"), 2- [3- carbamoyl-4-(2-methylpropoxy)phenyl]-4-methyl- 1 ,3-thiazole-5-carboxylic acid impurity, and residual solvents. The process of the present invention provides crystalline Form G of febuxostat having a small particle size, without the need for carrying out micronization. \n A first aspect of the present invention provides a process for the preparation of crystalline Form G of febuxostat in a mixed solvent of methanol and water having a volume ratio of methanol to water from 5:95 to 45:55. \n Embodiments of the process may include one or more of the following features. For example, preparation of the crystalline Form G of febuxostat may be carried out at a temperature of about 50\u00b0C to about 70\u00b0C. \n The crystalline Form G of febuxostat may be substantially free of the genotoxic impurities selected from 2-[3-cyano-4-hydroxyphenyl]-4-methylthiazole-5-carboxylic acid ethyl ester, 1 -bromo-2-methylpropane, ethyl-2-chloroacetoacetate, methyl methane sulfonate, ethyl methane sulfonate, acetoacetic acid ethyl ester, ethyl 2,2-dichloro-3- oxobutanoate, and n-butyl bromide. In particular, the crystalline Form G of febuxostat may be substantially free of the febuxostat ethyl ester impurity, the 2-[3-carbamoyl-4-(2- methylpropoxy)phenyl]-4-methyl-l,3-thiazole-5-carboxylic acid impurity, and/or methanol. \n In the process, the volume ratio of methanol to water may be about 37.5:62.5, about 35.3:64.7, or about 40:60. The volume ratio of methanol to water may range from about 35:65 to about 40:60. \n A second aspect of the present invention provides crystalline form G of febuxostat, wherein the particle size of 90% of the particles is less than 15 \u03bc\u03b9\u03b7. \n Brief Description of Figures \n Figure 1 : X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern of crystalline Form G of febuxostat. \n Figure 2: Particle size distribution of crystalline Form G of febuxostat prepared by the process of the present invention. \n\n Detailed Description of the Invention \n Various embodiments and variants of the present invention are described hereinafter. \n Crystalline Form G of febuxostat refers to the crystalline Form G of febuxostat disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,225,474, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, in particular for data characterizing Form G of febuxostat such as the x-ray diffraction data and infrared spectroscopic absorption data disclosed therein. \n The term \\\"about\\\", as used herein, refers to any value which lies within the range defined by a variation of up to \u00b110% of the value. \n The term \\\"substantially free of genotoxic impurities\\\", as used herein, refers to the crystalline Form G of febuxostat obtained by the process of the present invention having less than 0.001% of genotoxic impurities.

        "description": "FIELD OF THE INVENTION\nThe present invention relates to crystalline form I of Febuxostat as well as to pharmaceutical compositions comprising crystalline form I as an active pharmaceutical ingredient. Furthermore the present invention relates to a further polymorphic form of Febuxostat designated as form II and a novel solvate of Febuxostat. The present invention also relates to methods of making crystalline form I, form II and the novel solvate of Febuxostat.\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\nFebuxostat, 2-(3-cyano-4-isobutyloxy-phenyl)-4-methyl-5-thiazolecarboxylic acid regulates the biosynthesis of uric acid in vivo and is indicated for the use in the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout. It received marketing approval in EU (brand name Adenuric) and US (brand name Uloric) and is represented by the following general formula (I):\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nSpecific crystal forms of Febuxostat designated as forms A, B, C, D and G are disclosed for example in EP 1020454.\nPolymorphism is a phenomenon relating to the occurrence of different crystal forms for one molecule. There may be several different crystalline forms for the same molecule with distinct crystal structures and varying in physical properties like melting point. XRPD spectrum and IR-spectrum. These polymorphs are thus distinct solid forms which share the molecular formula of the compound from which the crystals are made up, however they may have distinct advantageous physical properties which can have a direct effect on the ability to process and/or manufacture the drug substance, like flowability, and the drug product, like flowability, as well as on drug product stability, dissolution, and bioavailability.\nThese distinct physical properties of different polymorphs of the same compound can render different polymorphs more, or less, useful for a particular purpose, such as for pharmaceutical formulation.\nThe crystal forms of Febuxostat disclosed for example in EP1020454, namely anhydrate A, anhydrate B, anhydrate C, hydrate G and a solvate with methanol (Form D) have certain drawbacks. The drawbacks of forms other than form A are explained in U.S. Pat. No. 7,361,676.\nU.S. Pat. No. 7,361,676 discloses formulations comprising form A. In the comparative examples of said patent the drawbacks using known forms of Febuxostat others than form A are presented and explained in detail. The problems encountered with the non-A forms are, for example, polymorph conversion during formulation or stability studies resulting in non uniform dissolution. Polymorph A according to both references above is therefore the preferred solid state form of Febuxostat intended for formulation, however the solubility of form A is limited, as it has a value of 0.22 mg/ml.\nMoreover, the preferred form A is difficult to make as form A is said to be obtainable in pure form only in a quite narrow window of temperature and methanol/water ratio in the region I as shown in FIG. 1 of EP1020454. The process to obtain pure form A is especially critical, as different polymorphic forms of Febuxostat are obtainable from the same solvent system.\nCrystal forms of Febuxostat with both higher solubility and fewer problems with regard to polymorphic conversion during preparation and/or typical formulation conditions would facilitate the production of pharmaceutical compositions while at the same time more efficiently provide Febuxostat to a patient in need thereof. There is thus a need for solid forms of Febuxostat which avoid one or more problems of the known crystal forms.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nThe present invention relates to a new crystalline form of Febuxostat, which is now designated as form I, and pharmaceutical compositions comprising form I. The present invention also relates to new processes for the preparation of form I in which processes novel crystalline intermediates designated as form II of Febuxostat and a tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat are employed for the preparation of form I of Febuxostat.\nCrystalline form I of Febuxostat is stable as crystalline form I under a variety of conditions typically employed for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions and upon storage. Moreover, form I has improved solid state properties, such as a high solubility in water, when compared to the available polymorphs of Febuxostat, in particular compared to the previously preferred form A of the prior art. Crystalline form I therefore is a highly valuable polymorph for the preparation of pharmaceuticals.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING\n FIG. 1: XRPD pattern of form I of Febuxostat\n FIG. 2: IR spectrum of form I of Febuxostat\n FIG. 3: Dynamic moisture sorption/desorption curve of form I of Febuxostat\n FIG. 4: XRPD pattern of form II of Febuxostat\n FIG. 5: IR spectrum of Form II of Febuxostat\n FIG. 6: XRPD pattern of the tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat\n FIG. 7: TGA curve of the tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat\n FIG. 8: Comparison of the solubility of form I with form A in MeOH/H2O (50%:50% v/v)\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\nAs used herein, a \u201csolvate\u201d is a crystalline molecular compound in which molecules of the solvent are incorporated into the host lattice consisting of unsolvated molecules. A \u201chydrate\u201d is a special kind of solvate, wherein the incorporated solvent is water. An \u201canhydrous\u201d form is thus a form wherein no water molecules are incorporated into the host molecule crystal lattice.\nThe term \u201csignificant peaks\u201d used herein and referring to XRD diffraction pattern generally means characteristic peaks as typically understood by a person skilled in the art for an XRD characterization. For example, \u201csignificant peaks\u201d can be typically defined by having relative intensities to the most intense peak (intensity 100) of at least 10%, preferably of at least 20%, more preferably of at least 30%.\nIn a first aspect the present invention relates to a crystalline form of Febuxostat (hereinafter also referred to as form I).\nForm I of Febuxostat can be characterized by an XRPD pattern comprising peaks at 2-theta angles of 6.6\u00b10.2\u00b0, 12.8\u00b10.2\u00b0, 24.5\u00b10.2, 25.8\u00b10.2\u00b0 and 26.6\u00b10.2\u00b0.\nPreferably and notably, Form I of Febuxostat can be characterized by an XRD pattern as measured using CuK\u03b1 radiation comprising significant peaks at 2-theta angles of 6.6\u00b10.2\u00b0, 12.8\u00b10.2\u00b0, 24.5\u00b10.2\u00b0, 25.8\u00b10.2\u00b0 and 26.6\u00b10.2\u00b0, and optionally further at 2-theta angle 23.8\u00b10.2\u00b0.\nIntensities used for the specification of Form I of Febuxostat above were all found to be greater than at least 10%, preferably greater than 20%, more preferably greater than 30% relative to the most intense peak for Form I of Febuxostat at 2-theta angles of 6.6\u00b10.2\u00b0.\nAlternatively form I of Febuxostat can alternatively be described by an IR spectrum comprising peaks at wavenumbers of 2960\u00b12 cm\u22121, 2874\u00b12 cm\u22121, 2535\u00b12 cm\u22121, 2229\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1673\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1605\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1509\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1422\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1368\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1323\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1274\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1166\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1116\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1045\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1013\u00b12 cm\u22121, 911\u00b12 cm\u22121, 820\u00b12 cm\u22121, 763\u00b12 cm\u22121 and 725\u00b12 cm\u22121.\nThe crystalline form I can be characterized as being an anhydrous form, that is its water content when stored at 20\u00b0 C. at ambient pressure in an environment from 0% up to 90% relative humidity is below 0.1% according to Karl Fischer (KF), more preferably below 0.05% KF.\nThe present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of form I. Form I of Febuxostat may be prepared from crystalline form II, further described below, by a process comprising the step of:\n    a) heating crystalline form II to about 200\u00b0 C., b) keeping crystalline form II at about 200\u00b0 C. for a time sufficient to allow conversion into form I, and c) recovering form I.   \nThe transformation at about 200\u00b0 C. is preferably carried out by keeping the temperature at that value for least one minute up to 1 hour, more preferably for 3 minutes to 30 minutes. For large amounts of crystalline form II to be converted these times may be increased so as to allow and assure complete conversion to form I. The skilled person will appreciate that conversion can be monitored, and completion of conversion determined, by XRPD measurements.\nThe term \u201cabout\u201d, used herein in connection with the indication of the transformation temperature, refers to a temperature range where crystal transformation takes place. As generally understood, it means that the transformation does not take place at an exact temperature, but rather reasonably around the indicated value, e.g. typically at temperatures\u00b110\u00b0 C. of the stated value, further noting that crystal transformation can be influenced not only by temperature but also by other ambient conditions such as humidity and pressure.\nThe present invention also provides an alternative process for the generation of form I comprising the steps of:\n    a) heating crystalline form II of Febuxostat to a temperature of at least 150\u00b0 C., more preferably from 155\u00b0 C. to 200\u00b0 C.; b) allowing vapor comprising Febuxostat to deposit onto a surface, in particular a surface having a temperature of below 150\u00b0 C., more preferably of from \u221230\u00b0 C. to 140\u00b0 C., even more preferably of from 0\u00b0 C. to 120\u00b0 C., and c) recovering form I of Febuxostat.   \nThe present invention also relates to a crystalline form I of Febuxostat obtainable by either one of the alternative processes as defined above starting from form II of Febuxostat.\nSurprisingly polymorph I of the invention shows better solubility compared to the known form A. The increase in solubility in an aqueous solution is approximately 20% (see example 3). Also surprisingly the kinetics of conversion to the known hemihydrate G in a mix of methanol and water is slower than the kinetics of the conversion of the of known anhydrate A to the known hemihydrate G, demonstrating improved polymorphic stability of novel form I.\nThe solvent system methanol/water represents a model for the dissolution of solid states of Febuxostat, with the hemihydrate G representing a thermodynamic very stable form with low solubility in aqueous systems.\nAs a further surprising advantage, the polymorph I of the invention is nonhygroscopic as shown by the moisture sorption/desorption experiment (see FIG. 3) and is therefore very suitable, for example for use in a wet granulation process for the production of pharmaceutical compositions comprising Febuxostat.\nAs a further surprising advantage polymorph I of Febuxostat is polymorphically very stable. It does not change its polymorphic state properties when stored for prolonged time e.g. under stress conditions, e.g. when stored at 40\u00b0 C. for 3 months.\nThe crystal form I of Febuxostat of the invention as described above may advantageously be employed in various pharmaceutical formulations for use in the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout and related diseases in accordance with the present invention. The present invention therefore also relates to a pharmaceutical composition which comprises the crystalline form I of Febuxostat as described above and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\nThe present invention therefore also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the crystalline form I of Febuxostat, wherein form I is the only detectable crystalline form of Febuxostat, in particular the present invention relates to such pharmaceutical compositions, wherein more than 95% of the crystalline form I present in said composition is stably present as form I.\n\u2018Stably present\u2019 as defined herein means that even after storage of the pharmaceutical composition for 180 days, and preferably even after storage for 2 years, the crystalline form of Febuxostat designated as form I initially comprised in the pharmaceutical composition is still present as crystalline form I after storage for the indicated period.\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the invention comprising the crystalline form I of Febuxostat may further comprise one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are preferably selected from the group consisting of fillers, sweeteners, buffering agents, glidants, flowing agents, flavouring agents, lubricants, preservatives, surfactants, wetting agents, binders, disintegrants and thickeners. Other excipients known in the field of pharmaceutical compositions may also be used. Furthermore, the pharmaceutical composition may comprise a combination of two or more excipients also within one of the members of the above mentioned group.\nExamples of suitable excipients for pharmaceutical compositions of the invention comprising febuxostat are given in US2005/0043375A1, which is herein incorporated by reference, in paragraphs [0027] to [0030]. The excipients are typically contained in an amount of 50 to 98 parts by weight, and more preferably 60 to 95 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the solid preparation.\nIn paragraph [0028] US2005/0043375A1 discloses examples of the disintegrating agent for the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprising febuxostat. The disclosed disintegrants, which can also be used for the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, include carmellose sodium, carmellose calcium, low-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, crosscarmellose sodium, carboxymethyl starch sodium and crosspovidone. Preferred disintegrants and preferred amounts for the disintegrating agent to be used in the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention are also disclosed in paragraph [0028] of US2005/0043375A1.\nIn paragraph [0029] US2005/0043375A1 discloses examples of additional excipients to be added in the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions comprising febuxostat, such as binders, lubricants, coating agents, plasticizers, diluents, colorants, preservatives, antiseptics or fragrance agents, which are also useful for the preparation of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention.\nIn paragraph [0030] US2005/0043375A1 discloses examples of binders for the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, such as hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxy propylmethyl cellulose, and polyvinyl pyrrolidone. The binder is contained in an amount of 0.5 to 25 parts by weight, and preferably 1 to 20 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention.\nExamples of suitable processes for the preparation of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are given in US2005/0043375A1, which is herein incorporated by reference, in paragraphs [0031] to [0033]. In summary the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are preferably solid preparations which can be produced by compressing a mixture of form I of the present invention with excipients and disintegrating agents. For example, one method for the production of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention includes mixing form I of the present invention with suitable excipients in a suitable mixer. The mixture can then be directly compressed to tablets. Alternatively, a dry granulation step can be employed so as to produce granules suitable for tablet production. A wet granulation step can be employed to produce granules suitable for tablet production, in which step water, ethanol and solutions containing binders can be used.\nSpecific examples for the production of tablets of the present invention are given in US2005/0043375A1, paragraphs [0034] to [0048]. These examples can be repeated using form I of the present invention instead of the crystals of febuxostat referred to in US2005/0043375A1, paragraphs [0034] to [0048].\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the invention comprising the crystalline form I of Febuxostat are preferably packaged or filled into containers. Containers are typically used for stable storage of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, for example at room temperature, such as at a temperature of about 20\u00b0 C. to 30\u00b0 C., e.g. at about 25\u00b0 C., for a prolonged period, e.g. for at least 6 months, preferably at least about 24 months, e.g. for up to at least 24 months, e.g. for up to at least about 30 months, such as for up to about 60 months.\nA preferred container is a bottle, in particular a glass bottle, having e.g. a screw closure, or is a blister, e.g. an aluminum blister or strip, e.g. a blister consisting of 2 aluminum foils or strips, or may be any other suitable container. More preferably said container is a gas-tight container, such as an air-tight container.\nPreferred containers are glass bottles sealed with an aluminum membrane, alu-alu-blisters or strips. The container according to the invention is obtained by filling the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention into said container.\nThe present invention also relates to the use of crystalline form I of Febuxostat for the production of a pharmaceutical composition, in particular a pharmaceutical composition intended for sale in a tropical country having areas with an Af or Am climate according to the Koppen-Geiger climate classification.\nIn a second aspect, the present invention relates to a further novel form of Febuxostat (hereinafter referred to as form II).\nForm II of Febuxostat can be characterized by an XRPD pattern comprising peaks at 2-theta angles of 2.9\u00b10.2\u00b0, 5.8\u00b10.2\u00b0, 12.0\u00b10.2\u00b0, 12.3\u00b10.2\u00b0 and 25.2\u00b10.2\u00b0.\nNotably, Form II of Febuxostat can be characterized by an XRPD pattern as measured using CuK\u03b1 radiation comprising the aforementioned peaks at 2-theta angles of 2.9\u00b10.2\u00b0, 5.8\u00b10.2\u00b0, 12.0\u00b10.2\u00b0, 12.3\u00b10.2\u00b0 and 25.2\u00b10.2\u00b0 as significant peaks.\nIntensities used for the specification of Form II of Febuxostat above were all found to be greater than at least 10% relative to the most intense peak for Form II of Febuxostat at 2-theta angles of 2.9\u00b10.2\u00b0.\nAlternatively form II of Febuxostat can be described by an IR spectrum comprising peaks at wavenumbers of 2960\u00b12 cm\u22121, 2874\u00b12 cm\u22121, 2537\u00b12 cm\u22121, 2229\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1684\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1656\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1605\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1510\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1428\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1371\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1326\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1280\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1173\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1115\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1043\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1008\u00b12 cm\u22121, 958\u00b12 cm\u22121, 915\u00b12 cm\u22121, 827\u00b12 cm\u22121, 765\u00b12 cm\u22121 and 725\u00b12 cm\u22121.\nThe present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of form II of Febuxostat comprising the steps of:\n    a) dissolving Febuxostat in nitromethane; b) allowing form II of febuxostat to crystallize; c) recovering crystalline form II of Febuxostat from the solution; and d) optionally drying the form II crystals.   \nTypically any form of Febuxostat including amorphous Febuxostat is dissolved in nitromethane preferably at elevated temperature, e.g. at 40\u00b0 C. up to the boiling point of the solvent whereas form II is formed upon cooling. In a preferred embodiment the solution is cooled to a temperature of 10\u00b0 to \u221210\u00b0 C., preferably +5\u00b0 to 0\u00b0 C. quickly, e.g. by placing the solution in an icebath.\nForm II may be isolated by conventional methods, e.g. by filtration and drying, e.g. in vacuo. Form II of Febuxostat is stable under ambient laboratory conditions, e.g. it does not convert to another polymorphic form when stored e.g. at ambient temperature for 6 weeks.\nForm II of Febuxostat is a valuable intermediate for the manufacture of form I of Febuxostat. Form II of Febuxostat may be transformed to form I of Febuxostat according to the processes disclosed for form I production above.\nIn a third aspect the present invention refers to a novel crystalline tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat.\nThe novel crystalline tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat can be characterized by an XRPD pattern comprising peaks at 2-theta angles of 6.1\u00b10.2\u00b0, 8.6\u00b10.2\u00b0, 11.4\u00b10.2\u00b0, 17.3\u00b10.2\u00b0 and 25.3\u00b10.2\u00b0.\nNotably, the novel crystalline tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat can be characterized by an XRPD pattern as measured using CuK\u03b1 radiation comprising the aforementioned peaks at 2-theta angles of 6.1\u00b10.2\u00b0, 8.6\u00b10.2\u00b0, 11.4\u00b10.2\u00b0, 17.3\u00b10.2\u00b0 and 25.3\u00b10.2\u00b0 as significant peaks.\nIntensities used for the specification of the tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat above were all found to be greater than 10% relative to the most intense peak for the tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat at 2-theta angles of 6.1\u00b10.2\u00b0.\nThe tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat contains about 0.4 mol to 0.6 mol of tert.-amylalcohol. TGA shows for example a mass loss of about 13.2% corresponding to 0.55 mol tert.-amylalcohol per mol of Febuxostat.\nIn another embodiment the present invention therefore relates to a process for the preparation of the tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat comprising the step of:\n    a) dissolving Febuxostat in tert.-amylalcohol; b) concentrating the solution of step a) by evaporating the solvent, thereby allowing the tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat to crystallize; and c) recovering the tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat.   \nThe amount of tert.-amylalcohol in the process for the preparation of the novel solvate is not critical, however a solution of Febuxostat in tert.-amylalcohol has to be ensured, optionally with the help of a filtration step.\nThe tert.-amylalcohol solvate is stable, e.g. when stored under ambient conditions in open atmosphere for several weeks, e.g. for 5 weeks.\nThe present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of form I of Febuxostat from the tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat comprising the steps of:\n    a) heating the tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat; and b) recovering form I of Febuxostat.   \nThe tert-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat is a valuable intermediate for the manufacture of form I of Febuxostat. The tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat may be transformed to form I of Febuxostat according to the process disclosed for form I production starting from tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat above.\nTypically the tert.-amylalcohol solvate is heated to a temperature range of 130\u00b0 C. to 180\u00b0 C., preferably to 140\u00b0 C. to 160\u00b0 C. for a certain period of time. Typically dependent on the temperature several minutes to several hours are required to complete the transformation, e.g. at a temperature of about 150\u00b0 C. the transformation is complete in less than 6 hours. The transformation may be monitored by classical methods, e.g. XRPD analysis. At lower temperatures, a desolvated intermediate is formed.\nThe present invention also relates to a crystalline form I of Febuxostat obtainable by the process as defined above starting from the tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat.\nOther objects, features, advantages and aspects of the present invention will become apparent to those of skill from the following description. It should be understood, however, that the description and the following specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only. Various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the disclosed invention will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from reading the description and the other parts of the present disclosure.\nEXAMPLES\nXRPD patterns were obtained with an X'Pert PRO diffractometer (PANalytical, Almelo, The Netherlands) equipped with a theta/theta coupled goniometer in transmission geometry, programmable XYZ stage with well plate holder. CuK\u03b1 radiation source (CuK\u03b11,2; wavelength 0.15419 nm) with a focusing mirror, a 0.5\u00b0 divergence slit, a 0.02\u00b0 soller slit collimator and a 1\u00b0 anti-scattering slit on the incident beam side, a 2 mm anti-scattering slit, a 0.02\u00b0 soller slit collimator and a Nickel filter on the diffracted beam side and a solid state PIXcel detector. The patterns were recorded at a tube voltage of 40 kV, tube current of 40 mA, applying a stepsize of 0.013\u00b0 2-theta with 80 s per step in the angular range of 2\u00b0 to 40\u00b0 2-theta.\nThe IR spectra were collected on a MKII Golden Gate\u2122 Single Reflection Diamond ATR (attenuated total reflection) cell with a Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR spectrometer with 4 cm\u22121 resolution at ambient conditions. To collect a spectrum a spatula tip of a sample was applied to the surface of the diamond in powder form. Then the sample was pressed onto the diamond with a sapphire anvil and the spectrum was recorded. A spectrum of the clean diamond was used as background spectrum. Atypical precision of the wavenumber values is in the range of about \u00b12 cm\u22121. Thus, an infrared peak that appears at 1716 cm\u22121 can appear between 1714 and 1718 cm\u22121 on most infrared spectrometers under standard conditions.\nTGA's were performed with Thermogravimetric-system TGA-7, Pyris-Software for Windows NT, (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, Conn., USA), Platinum-sample holder (50 \u03bcl), Nitrogen as the purge gas (Sample purge: 20 ml/min, balance purge: 40 ml/min). Heating rate: 10\u00b0 C./min;\nThe moisture sorption/desorption isotherms were recorded with a SPS-11 moisture sorption analyzer (MD Messtechnik, Ulm, D). In the experiment displayed in FIG. 5 the measurement cycle was started at 0% RH increased in 10% steps up to 90% RH, decreased in 10% steps down to 0% RH, increased in 10% steps up to 90% RH and finally decreased in 10% steps down to 0% RH. In the experiments displayed in FIG. 8 and FIG. 9 the measurement cycle was started at 0% RH, increased in 10% steps up to 90% RH and decreased in 10% steps down to 0% RH. The equilibrium condition for each step was set to a mass constancy of \u00b10.01% over 30 min. The temperature was 25\u00b10.1\u00b0 C.\nExample 1\nPreparation of Febuxostat Form II\n1.0 g of form A of 2-(3-cyano-4-isobutyloxyphenyl)-4-methyl-5-thiazolecarboxylic acid (Febuxostat) were dissolved in 120 ml nitromethane upon heating to 75\u00b0 C. The clear solution was filtered through 0.44 \u03bcm milipore filter. The solution was then quickly cooled in an icebath and the suspension was stirred in the icebath for further 30 min. The crystals were filtered off and dried in vacuo for 3 h at about 60 mbar.\nYield: 820 mg\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nXRPD angles 2-theta, relative intensities of form II of Febuxostat\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \nangle\nrel intensity\n\n\n \n[2-Theta]\u00b0\n[%]\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n2.89\n100\n\n\n \n4.07\n5\n\n\n \n5.83\n14\n\n\n \n7.36\n5\n\n\n \n7.87\n5\n\n\n \n8.76\n6\n\n\n \n10.17\n5\n\n\n \n11.99\n14\n\n\n \n12.26\n34\n\n\n \n13.40\n7\n\n\n \n14.64\n5\n\n\n \n17.47\n6\n\n\n \n17.83\n6\n\n\n \n23.73\n5\n\n\n \n24.34\n12\n\n\n \n25.22\n17\n\n\n \n26.01\n7\n\n\n \n27.28\n5\n\n\n \n29.47\n3\n\n\n \n29.78\n2\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm II of Febuxostat can be classified as non hygroscopic.

        "description": "FIELD OF THE INVENTION\nThe present invention relates to crystalline form I of Febuxostat as well as to pharmaceutical compositions comprising crystalline form I as an active pharmaceutical ingredient. Furthermore the present invention relates to a further polymorphic form of Febuxostat designated as form II and a novel solvate of Febuxostat. The present invention also relates to methods of making crystalline form I, form II and the novel solvate of Febuxostat.\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\nFebuxostat, 2-(3-cyano-4-isobutyloxy-phenyl)-4-methyl-5-thiazolecarboxylic acid regulates the biosynthesis of uric acid in vivo and is indicated for the use in the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout. It received marketing approval in EU (brand name Adenuric) and US (brand name Uloric) and is represented by the following general formula (I):\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nSpecific crystal forms of Febuxostat designated as forms A, B, C, D and G are disclosed for example in EP 1020454.\nPolymorphism is a phenomenon relating to the occurrence of different crystal forms for one molecule. There may be several different crystalline forms for the same molecule with distinct crystal structures and varying in physical properties like melting point. XRPD spectrum and IR-spectrum. These polymorphs are thus distinct solid forms which share the molecular formula of the compound from which the crystals are made up, however they may have distinct advantageous physical properties which can have a direct effect on the ability to process and/or manufacture the drug substance, like flowability, and the drug product, like flowability, as well as on drug product stability, dissolution, and bioavailability.\nThese distinct physical properties of different polymorphs of the same compound can render different polymorphs more, or less, useful for a particular purpose, such as for pharmaceutical formulation.\nThe crystal forms of Febuxostat disclosed for example in EP1020454, namely anhydrate A, anhydrate B, anhydrate C, hydrate G and a solvate with methanol (Form D) have certain drawbacks. The drawbacks of forms other than form A are explained in U.S. Pat. No. 7,361,676.\nU.S. Pat. No. 7,361,676 discloses formulations comprising form A. In the comparative examples of said patent the drawbacks using known forms of Febuxostat others than form A are presented and explained in detail. The problems encountered with the non-A forms are, for example, polymorph conversion during formulation or stability studies resulting in non uniform dissolution. Polymorph A according to both references above is therefore the preferred solid state form of Febuxostat intended for formulation, however the solubility of form A is limited, as it has a value of 0.22 mg/ml.\nMoreover, the preferred form A is difficult to make as form A is said to be obtainable in pure form only in a quite narrow window of temperature and methanol/water ratio in the region I as shown in FIG. 1 of EP1020454. The process to obtain pure form A is especially critical, as different polymorphic forms of Febuxostat are obtainable from the same solvent system.\nCrystal forms of Febuxostat with both higher solubility and fewer problems with regard to polymorphic conversion during preparation and/or typical formulation conditions would facilitate the production of pharmaceutical compositions while at the same time more efficiently provide Febuxostat to a patient in need thereof. There is thus a need for solid forms of Febuxostat which avoid one or more problems of the known crystal forms.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nThe present invention relates to a new crystalline form of Febuxostat, which is now designated as form I, and pharmaceutical compositions comprising form I. The present invention also relates to new processes for the preparation of form I in which processes novel crystalline intermediates designated as form II of Febuxostat and a tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat are employed for the preparation of form I of Febuxostat.\nCrystalline form I of Febuxostat is stable as crystalline form I under a variety of conditions typically employed for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions and upon storage. Moreover, form I has improved solid state properties, such as a high solubility in water, when compared to the available polymorphs of Febuxostat, in particular compared to the previously preferred form A of the prior art. Crystalline form I therefore is a highly valuable polymorph for the preparation of pharmaceuticals.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING\n FIG. 1: XRPD pattern of form I of Febuxostat\n FIG. 2: IR spectrum of form I of Febuxostat\n FIG. 3: Dynamic moisture sorption/desorption curve of form I of Febuxostat\n FIG. 4: XRPD pattern of form II of Febuxostat\n FIG. 5: IR spectrum of Form II of Febuxostat\n FIG. 6: XRPD pattern of the tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat\n FIG. 7: TGA curve of the tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat\n FIG. 8: Comparison of the solubility of form I with form A in MeOH/H2O (50%:50% v/v)\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\nAs used herein, a \u201csolvate\u201d is a crystalline molecular compound in which molecules of the solvent are incorporated into the host lattice consisting of unsolvated molecules. A \u201chydrate\u201d is a special kind of solvate, wherein the incorporated solvent is water. An \u201canhydrous\u201d form is thus a form wherein no water molecules are incorporated into the host molecule crystal lattice.\nThe term \u201csignificant peaks\u201d used herein and referring to XRD diffraction pattern generally means characteristic peaks as typically understood by a person skilled in the art for an XRD characterization. For example, \u201csignificant peaks\u201d can be typically defined by having relative intensities to the most intense peak (intensity 100) of at least 10%, preferably of at least 20%, more preferably of at least 30%.\nIn a first aspect the present invention relates to a crystalline form of Febuxostat (hereinafter also referred to as form I).\nForm I of Febuxostat can be characterized by an XRPD pattern comprising peaks at 2-theta angles of 6.6\u00b10.2\u00b0, 12.8\u00b10.2\u00b0, 24.5\u00b10.2, 25.8\u00b10.2\u00b0 and 26.6\u00b10.2\u00b0.\nPreferably and notably, Form I of Febuxostat can be characterized by an XRD pattern as measured using CuK\u03b1 radiation comprising significant peaks at 2-theta angles of 6.6\u00b10.2\u00b0, 12.8\u00b10.2\u00b0, 24.5\u00b10.2\u00b0, 25.8\u00b10.2\u00b0 and 26.6\u00b10.2\u00b0, and optionally further at 2-theta angle 23.8\u00b10.2\u00b0.\nIntensities used for the specification of Form I of Febuxostat above were all found to be greater than at least 10%, preferably greater than 20%, more preferably greater than 30% relative to the most intense peak for Form I of Febuxostat at 2-theta angles of 6.6\u00b10.2\u00b0.\nAlternatively form I of Febuxostat can alternatively be described by an IR spectrum comprising peaks at wavenumbers of 2960\u00b12 cm\u22121, 2874\u00b12 cm\u22121, 2535\u00b12 cm\u22121, 2229\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1673\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1605\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1509\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1422\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1368\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1323\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1274\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1166\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1116\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1045\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1013\u00b12 cm\u22121, 911\u00b12 cm\u22121, 820\u00b12 cm\u22121, 763\u00b12 cm\u22121 and 725\u00b12 cm\u22121.\nThe crystalline form I can be characterized as being an anhydrous form, that is its water content when stored at 20\u00b0 C. at ambient pressure in an environment from 0% up to 90% relative humidity is below 0.1% according to Karl Fischer (KF), more preferably below 0.05% KF.\nThe present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of form I. Form I of Febuxostat may be prepared from crystalline form II, further described below, by a process comprising the step of:\n    a) heating crystalline form II to about 200\u00b0 C., b) keeping crystalline form II at about 200\u00b0 C. for a time sufficient to allow conversion into form I, and c) recovering form I.   \nThe transformation at about 200\u00b0 C. is preferably carried out by keeping the temperature at that value for least one minute up to 1 hour, more preferably for 3 minutes to 30 minutes. For large amounts of crystalline form II to be converted these times may be increased so as to allow and assure complete conversion to form I. The skilled person will appreciate that conversion can be monitored, and completion of conversion determined, by XRPD measurements.\nThe term \u201cabout\u201d, used herein in connection with the indication of the transformation temperature, refers to a temperature range where crystal transformation takes place. As generally understood, it means that the transformation does not take place at an exact temperature, but rather reasonably around the indicated value, e.g. typically at temperatures\u00b110\u00b0 C. of the stated value, further noting that crystal transformation can be influenced not only by temperature but also by other ambient conditions such as humidity and pressure.\nThe present invention also provides an alternative process for the generation of form I comprising the steps of:\n    a) heating crystalline form II of Febuxostat to a temperature of at least 150\u00b0 C., more preferably from 155\u00b0 C. to 200\u00b0 C.; b) allowing vapor comprising Febuxostat to deposit onto a surface, in particular a surface having a temperature of below 150\u00b0 C., more preferably of from \u221230\u00b0 C. to 140\u00b0 C., even more preferably of from 0\u00b0 C. to 120\u00b0 C., and c) recovering form I of Febuxostat.   \nThe present invention also relates to a crystalline form I of Febuxostat obtainable by either one of the alternative processes as defined above starting from form II of Febuxostat.\nSurprisingly polymorph I of the invention shows better solubility compared to the known form A. The increase in solubility in an aqueous solution is approximately 20% (see example 3). Also surprisingly the kinetics of conversion to the known hemihydrate G in a mix of methanol and water is slower than the kinetics of the conversion of the of known anhydrate A to the known hemihydrate G, demonstrating improved polymorphic stability of novel form I.\nThe solvent system methanol/water represents a model for the dissolution of solid states of Febuxostat, with the hemihydrate G representing a thermodynamic very stable form with low solubility in aqueous systems.\nAs a further surprising advantage, the polymorph I of the invention is nonhygroscopic as shown by the moisture sorption/desorption experiment (see FIG. 3) and is therefore very suitable, for example for use in a wet granulation process for the production of pharmaceutical compositions comprising Febuxostat.\nAs a further surprising advantage polymorph I of Febuxostat is polymorphically very stable. It does not change its polymorphic state properties when stored for prolonged time e.g. under stress conditions, e.g. when stored at 40\u00b0 C. for 3 months.\nThe crystal form I of Febuxostat of the invention as described above may advantageously be employed in various pharmaceutical formulations for use in the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout and related diseases in accordance with the present invention. The present invention therefore also relates to a pharmaceutical composition which comprises the crystalline form I of Febuxostat as described above and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\nThe present invention therefore also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the crystalline form I of Febuxostat, wherein form I is the only detectable crystalline form of Febuxostat, in particular the present invention relates to such pharmaceutical compositions, wherein more than 95% of the crystalline form I present in said composition is stably present as form I.\n\u2018Stably present\u2019 as defined herein means that even after storage of the pharmaceutical composition for 180 days, and preferably even after storage for 2 years, the crystalline form of Febuxostat designated as form I initially comprised in the pharmaceutical composition is still present as crystalline form I after storage for the indicated period.\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the invention comprising the crystalline form I of Febuxostat may further comprise one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are preferably selected from the group consisting of fillers, sweeteners, buffering agents, glidants, flowing agents, flavouring agents, lubricants, preservatives, surfactants, wetting agents, binders, disintegrants and thickeners. Other excipients known in the field of pharmaceutical compositions may also be used. Furthermore, the pharmaceutical composition may comprise a combination of two or more excipients also within one of the members of the above mentioned group.\nExamples of suitable excipients for pharmaceutical compositions of the invention comprising febuxostat are given in US2005/0043375A1, which is herein incorporated by reference, in paragraphs [0027] to [0030]. The excipients are typically contained in an amount of 50 to 98 parts by weight, and more preferably 60 to 95 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the solid preparation.\nIn paragraph [0028] US2005/0043375A1 discloses examples of the disintegrating agent for the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprising febuxostat. The disclosed disintegrants, which can also be used for the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, include carmellose sodium, carmellose calcium, low-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, crosscarmellose sodium, carboxymethyl starch sodium and crosspovidone. Preferred disintegrants and preferred amounts for the disintegrating agent to be used in the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention are also disclosed in paragraph [0028] of US2005/0043375A1.\nIn paragraph [0029] US2005/0043375A1 discloses examples of additional excipients to be added in the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions comprising febuxostat, such as binders, lubricants, coating agents, plasticizers, diluents, colorants, preservatives, antiseptics or fragrance agents, which are also useful for the preparation of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention.\nIn paragraph [0030] US2005/0043375A1 discloses examples of binders for the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, such as hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxy propylmethyl cellulose, and polyvinyl pyrrolidone. The binder is contained in an amount of 0.5 to 25 parts by weight, and preferably 1 to 20 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention.\nExamples of suitable processes for the preparation of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are given in US2005/0043375A1, which is herein incorporated by reference, in paragraphs [0031] to [0033]. In summary the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are preferably solid preparations which can be produced by compressing a mixture of form I of the present invention with excipients and disintegrating agents. For example, one method for the production of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention includes mixing form I of the present invention with suitable excipients in a suitable mixer. The mixture can then be directly compressed to tablets. Alternatively, a dry granulation step can be employed so as to produce granules suitable for tablet production. A wet granulation step can be employed to produce granules suitable for tablet production, in which step water, ethanol and solutions containing binders can be used.\nSpecific examples for the production of tablets of the present invention are given in US2005/0043375A1, paragraphs [0034] to [0048]. These examples can be repeated using form I of the present invention instead of the crystals of febuxostat referred to in US2005/0043375A1, paragraphs [0034] to [0048].\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the invention comprising the crystalline form I of Febuxostat are preferably packaged or filled into containers. Containers are typically used for stable storage of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, for example at room temperature, such as at a temperature of about 20\u00b0 C. to 30\u00b0 C., e.g. at about 25\u00b0 C., for a prolonged period, e.g. for at least 6 months, preferably at least about 24 months, e.g. for up to at least 24 months, e.g. for up to at least about 30 months, such as for up to about 60 months.\nA preferred container is a bottle, in particular a glass bottle, having e.g. a screw closure, or is a blister, e.g. an aluminum blister or strip, e.g. a blister consisting of 2 aluminum foils or strips, or may be any other suitable container. More preferably said container is a gas-tight container, such as an air-tight container.\nPreferred containers are glass bottles sealed with an aluminum membrane, alu-alu-blisters or strips. The container according to the invention is obtained by filling the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention into said container.\nThe present invention also relates to the use of crystalline form I of Febuxostat for the production of a pharmaceutical composition, in particular a pharmaceutical composition intended for sale in a tropical country having areas with an Af or Am climate according to the Koppen-Geiger climate classification.\nIn a second aspect, the present invention relates to a further novel form of Febuxostat (hereinafter referred to as form II).\nForm II of Febuxostat can be characterized by an XRPD pattern comprising peaks at 2-theta angles of 2.9\u00b10.2\u00b0, 5.8\u00b10.2\u00b0, 12.0\u00b10.2\u00b0, 12.3\u00b10.2\u00b0 and 25.2\u00b10.2\u00b0.\nNotably, Form II of Febuxostat can be characterized by an XRPD pattern as measured using CuK\u03b1 radiation comprising the aforementioned peaks at 2-theta angles of 2.9\u00b10.2\u00b0, 5.8\u00b10.2\u00b0, 12.0\u00b10.2\u00b0, 12.3\u00b10.2\u00b0 and 25.2\u00b10.2\u00b0 as significant peaks.\nIntensities used for the specification of Form II of Febuxostat above were all found to be greater than at least 10% relative to the most intense peak for Form II of Febuxostat at 2-theta angles of 2.9\u00b10.2\u00b0.\nAlternatively form II of Febuxostat can be described by an IR spectrum comprising peaks at wavenumbers of 2960\u00b12 cm\u22121, 2874\u00b12 cm\u22121, 2537\u00b12 cm\u22121, 2229\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1684\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1656\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1605\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1510\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1428\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1371\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1326\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1280\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1173\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1115\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1043\u00b12 cm\u22121, 1008\u00b12 cm\u22121, 958\u00b12 cm\u22121, 915\u00b12 cm\u22121, 827\u00b12 cm\u22121, 765\u00b12 cm\u22121 and 725\u00b12 cm\u22121.\nThe present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of form II of Febuxostat comprising the steps of:\n    a) dissolving Febuxostat in nitromethane; b) allowing form II of febuxostat to crystallize; c) recovering crystalline form II of Febuxostat from the solution; and d) optionally drying the form II crystals.   \nTypically any form of Febuxostat including amorphous Febuxostat is dissolved in nitromethane preferably at elevated temperature, e.g. at 40\u00b0 C. up to the boiling point of the solvent whereas form II is formed upon cooling. In a preferred embodiment the solution is cooled to a temperature of 10\u00b0 to \u221210\u00b0 C., preferably +5\u00b0 to 0\u00b0 C. quickly, e.g. by placing the solution in an icebath.\nForm II may be isolated by conventional methods, e.g. by filtration and drying, e.g. in vacuo. Form II of Febuxostat is stable under ambient laboratory conditions, e.g. it does not convert to another polymorphic form when stored e.g. at ambient temperature for 6 weeks.\nForm II of Febuxostat is a valuable intermediate for the manufacture of form I of Febuxostat. Form II of Febuxostat may be transformed to form I of Febuxostat according to the processes disclosed for form I production above.\nIn a third aspect the present invention refers to a novel crystalline tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat.\nThe novel crystalline tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat can be characterized by an XRPD pattern comprising peaks at 2-theta angles of 6.1\u00b10.2\u00b0, 8.6\u00b10.2\u00b0, 11.4\u00b10.2\u00b0, 17.3\u00b10.2\u00b0 and 25.3\u00b10.2\u00b0.\nNotably, the novel crystalline tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat can be characterized by an XRPD pattern as measured using CuK\u03b1 radiation comprising the aforementioned peaks at 2-theta angles of 6.1\u00b10.2\u00b0, 8.6\u00b10.2\u00b0, 11.4\u00b10.2\u00b0, 17.3\u00b10.2\u00b0 and 25.3\u00b10.2\u00b0 as significant peaks.\nIntensities used for the specification of the tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat above were all found to be greater than 10% relative to the most intense peak for the tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat at 2-theta angles of 6.1\u00b10.2\u00b0.\nThe tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat contains about 0.4 mol to 0.6 mol of tert.-amylalcohol. TGA shows for example a mass loss of about 13.2% corresponding to 0.55 mol tert.-amylalcohol per mol of Febuxostat.\nIn another embodiment the present invention therefore relates to a process for the preparation of the tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat comprising the step of:\n    a) dissolving Febuxostat in tert.-amylalcohol; b) concentrating the solution of step a) by evaporating the solvent, thereby allowing the tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat to crystallize; and c) recovering the tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat.   \nThe amount of tert.-amylalcohol in the process for the preparation of the novel solvate is not critical, however a solution of Febuxostat in tert.-amylalcohol has to be ensured, optionally with the help of a filtration step.\nThe tert.-amylalcohol solvate is stable, e.g. when stored under ambient conditions in open atmosphere for several weeks, e.g. for 5 weeks.\nThe present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of form I of Febuxostat from the tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat comprising the steps of:\n    a) heating the tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat; and b) recovering form I of Febuxostat.   \nThe tert-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat is a valuable intermediate for the manufacture of form I of Febuxostat. The tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat may be transformed to form I of Febuxostat according to the process disclosed for form I production starting from tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat above.\nTypically the tert.-amylalcohol solvate is heated to a temperature range of 130\u00b0 C. to 180\u00b0 C., preferably to 140\u00b0 C. to 160\u00b0 C. for a certain period of time. Typically dependent on the temperature several minutes to several hours are required to complete the transformation, e.g. at a temperature of about 150\u00b0 C. the transformation is complete in less than 6 hours. The transformation may be monitored by classical methods, e.g. XRPD analysis. At lower temperatures, a desolvated intermediate is formed.\nThe present invention also relates to a crystalline form I of Febuxostat obtainable by the process as defined above starting from the tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat.\nOther objects, features, advantages and aspects of the present invention will become apparent to those of skill from the following description. It should be understood, however, that the description and the following specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only. Various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the disclosed invention will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from reading the description and the other parts of the present disclosure.\nEXAMPLES\nXRPD patterns were obtained with an X'Pert PRO diffractometer (PANalytical, Almelo, The Netherlands) equipped with a theta/theta coupled goniometer in transmission geometry, programmable XYZ stage with well plate holder. CuK\u03b1 radiation source (CuK\u03b11,2; wavelength 0.15419 nm) with a focusing mirror, a 0.5\u00b0 divergence slit, a 0.02\u00b0 soller slit collimator and a 1\u00b0 anti-scattering slit on the incident beam side, a 2 mm anti-scattering slit, a 0.02\u00b0 soller slit collimator and a Nickel filter on the diffracted beam side and a solid state PIXcel detector. The patterns were recorded at a tube voltage of 40 kV, tube current of 40 mA, applying a stepsize of 0.013\u00b0 2-theta with 80 s per step in the angular range of 2\u00b0 to 40\u00b0 2-theta.\nThe IR spectra were collected on a MKII Golden Gate\u2122 Single Reflection Diamond ATR (attenuated total reflection) cell with a Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR spectrometer with 4 cm\u22121 resolution at ambient conditions. To collect a spectrum a spatula tip of a sample was applied to the surface of the diamond in powder form. Then the sample was pressed onto the diamond with a sapphire anvil and the spectrum was recorded. A spectrum of the clean diamond was used as background spectrum. Atypical precision of the wavenumber values is in the range of about \u00b12 cm\u22121.

        "description": "FIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n [0001]  The present invention relates to crystalline form I of Febuxostat as well as to pharmaceutical compositions comprising crystalline form I as an active pharmaceutical ingredient. Furthermore the present invention relates to a further polymorphic form of Febuxostat designated as form II and a novel solvate of Febuxostat. The present invention also relates to methods of making crystalline form I, form II and the novel solvate of Febuxostat.\n \nBackground of the Invention\n\n [0002]  Febuxostat, 2-(3-cyano-4-isobutyloxy-phenyl)-4-methyl-5-thiazolecarboxylic acid regulates the biosynthesis of uric acid in vivo and is indicated for the use in the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout. It received marketing approval in EU (brand name Adenuric) and US (brand name Uloric) and is represented by the following general formula (I):\n       \n  [0003]  Specific crystal forms of Febuxostat designated as forms A, B, C, D and G are disclosed for example in  EP 1020454 .\n  [0004]  Polymorphism is a phenomenon relating to the occurrence of different crystal forms for one molecule. There may be several different crystalline forms for the same molecule with distinct crystal structures and varying in physical properties like melting point, XRPD spectrum and IR-spectrum. These polymorphs are thus distinct solid forms which share the molecular formula of the compound from which the crystals are made up, however they may have distinct advantageous physical properties which can have a direct effect on the ability to process and/or manufacture the drug substance, like flowability, and the drug product, like flowability, as well as on drug product stability, dissolution, and bioavailability.\n  [0005]  These distinct physical properties of different polymorphs of the same compound can render different polymorphs more, or less, useful for a particular purpose, such as for pharmaceutical formulation.\n  [0006]  The crystal forms of Febuxostat disclosed for example in  EP1020454 , namely anhydrate A, anhydrate B, anhydrate C, hydrate G and a solvate with methanol (Form D) have certain drawbacks. The drawbacks of forms other than form A are explained in  US 7,361,676 .\n  [0007]    US 7,361,676  discloses formulations comprising form A. In the comparative examples of said patent the drawbacks using known forms of Febuxostat others than form A are presented and explained in detail. The problems encountered with the non-A forms are, for example, polymorph conversion during formulation or stability studies resulting in non uniform dissolution. Polymorph A according to both references above is therefore the preferred solid state form of Febuxostat intended for formulation, however the solubility of form A is limited, as it has a value of 0.22 mg/ml.\n  [0008]  Moreover, the preferred form A is difficult to make as form A is said to be obtainable in pure form only in a quite narrow window of temperature and methanol / water ratio in the region I as shown in Fig 1 of  EP1020454 . The process to obtain pure form A is especially critical, as different polymorphic forms of Febuxostat are obtainable from the same solvent system.\n  [0009]  Crystal forms of Febuxostat with both higher solubility and fewer problems with regard to polymorphic conversion during preparation and/or typical formulation conditions would facilitate the production of pharmaceutical compositions while at the same time more efficiently provide Febuxostat to a patient in need thereof. There is thus a need for solid forms of Febuxostat which avoid one or more problems of the known crystal forms.\n \nSummary of the Invention\n\n [0010]  The present invention relates to a new crystalline form of Febuxostat, which is now designated as form I, and pharmaceutical compositions comprising form I. The present invention also relates to new processes for the preparation of form I in which processes novel crystalline intermediates designated as form II of Febuxostat and a tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat are employed for the preparation of form I of Febuxostat.\n  [0011]  Crystalline form I of Febuxostat is stable as crystalline form I under a variety of conditions typically employed for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions and upon storage. Moreover, form I has improved solid state properties, such as a high solubility in water, when compared to the available polymorphs of Febuxostat, in particular compared to the previously preferred form A of the prior art. Crystalline form I therefore is a highly valuable polymorph for the preparation of pharmaceuticals.\n \nBrief Description of the Drawing\n\n [0012]  \n\n Figure 1: XRPD pattern of form I of Febuxostat\n Figure 2: IR spectrum of form I of Febuxostat\n Figure 3: Dynamic moisture sorption / desorption curve of form I of Febuxostat\n Figure 4: XRPD pattern of form II of Febuxostat\n Figure 5: IR spectrum of Form II of Febuxostat\n Figure 6: XRPD pattern of the tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat\n Figure 7: TGA curve of the tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat\n Figure 8: Comparison of the solubility of form I with form A in MeOH / H2O (50% : 50% v/v)\n\n\n \nDetailed Description of the Invention\n\n [0013]  As used herein, a \\\"solvate\\\" is a crystalline molecular compound in which molecules of the solvent are incorporated into the host lattice consisting of unsolvated molecules. A \\\"hydrate\\\" is a special kind of solvate, wherein the incorporated solvent is water. An \\\"anhydrous\\\" form is thus a form wherein no water molecules are incorporated into the host molecule crystal lattice.\n  [0014]  In a first aspect the present invention relates to a crystalline form of Febuxostat (hereinafter also referred to as form I).\n  [0015]  Form I of Febuxostat can be characterized by an XRPD pattern comprising peaks at 2-theta angles of 6.6 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0, 12.8 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0, 24.5 \u00b1 0.2, 25.8 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0 and 26.6 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0.\n  [0016]  Alternatively form I of Febuxostat can alternatively be described by an IR spectrum comprising peaks at wavenumbers of 2960 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 2874 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 2535 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 2229 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 1673 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 1605 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 1509 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 1422 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 1368 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 1323 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 1274 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 1166 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 1116 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 1045 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 1013 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 911 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 820 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 763 \u00b1 2 cm-1 and 725 \u00b1 2 cm-1.\n  [0017]  The crystalline form I can be characterized as being an anhydrous form, that is its water content when stored at 20\u00b0C at ambient pressure in an environment from 0% up to 90% relative humidity is below 0.1% according to Karl Fischer (KF), more preferably below 0.05% KF.\n  [0018]  The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of form I. Form I of Febuxostat may be prepared from crystalline form II, further described below, by a process comprising the step of:\n a) heating crystalline form II to about 200 \u00b0C, b) keeping crystalline form II at about 200\u00b0C for a time sufficient to allow conversion into form I, and c) recovering form I.  \n  [0019]  The transformation at about 200 \u00b0C is preferably carried out by keeping the temperature at that value for least one minute up to 1 hour, more preferably for 3 minutes to 30 minutes. For large amounts of crystalline form II to be converted these times my be increased so as to allow and assure complete conversion to form I. The skilled person will appreciate that conversion can be monitored, and completion of conversion determined, by XRPD measurements.\n  [0020]  The present invention also provides an alternative process for the generation of form I comprising the steps of:\n a) heating crystalline form II of Febuxostat to a temperature of at least 150 \u00b0C, more preferably from 155\u00b0C to 200\u00b0C; b) allowing vapor comprising Febuxostat to deposit onto a surface, in particular a surface having a temperature of below 150\u00b0C, more preferably of from -30\u00b0C to 140\u00b0C, even more preferably of from 0\u00b0C to 120\u00b0C, and c) recovering form I of Febuxostat.  \n  [0021]  Surprisingly polymorph I of the invention shows better solubility compared to the known form A. The increase in solubility in an aqueous solution is approximately 20 % (see example 3). Also surprisingly the kinetics of conversion to the known hemihydrate G in a mix of methanol and water is slower than the kinetics of the conversion of the of known anhydrate A to the known hemihydrate G, demonstrating improved polymorphic stability of novel form I.\n  [0022]  The solvent system methanol / water represents a model for the dissolution of solid states of Febuxostat, with the hemihydrate G representing a thermodynamic very stable form with low solubility in aqueous systems.\n  [0023]  As a further surprising advantage, the polymorph I of the invention is nonhygroscopic as shown by the moisture sorption / desorption experiment (see figure 3) and is therefore very suitable, for example for use in a wet granulation process for the production of pharmaceutical compositions comprising Febuxostat.\n  [0024]  As a further surprising advantage polymorph I of Febuxostat is polymorphically very stable. It does not change its polymorphic state properties when stored for prolonged time e.g. under stress conditions, e.g. when stored at 40 \u00b0C for 3 months.\n  [0025]  The crystal form I of Febuxostat of the invention as described above may advantageously be employed in various pharmaceutical formulations for use in the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout and related diseases in accordance with the present invention. The present invention therefore also relates to a pharmaceutical composition which comprises the crystalline form I of Febuxostat as described above and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n  [0026]  The present invention therefore also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the crystalline form I of Febuxostat, wherein form I is the only detectable crystalline form of Febuxostat, in particular the present invention relates to such pharmaceutical compositions, wherein more than 95 % of the crystalline form I present in said composition is stably present as form I.\n  [0027]  'Stably present' as defined herein means that even after storage of the pharmaceutical composition for 180 days, and preferably even after storage for 2 years, the crystalline form of Febuxostat designated as form I initially comprised in the pharmaceutical composition is still present as crystalline form I after storage for the indicated period.\n  [0028]  The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention comprising the crystalline form I of Febuxostat may further comprise one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are preferably selected from the group consisting of fillers, sweeteners, buffering agents, glidants, flowing agents, flavouring agents, lubricants, preservatives, surfactants, wetting agents, binders, disintegrants and thickeners. Other excipients known in the field of pharmaceutical compositions may also be used. Furthermore, the pharmaceutical composition may comprise a combination of two or more excipients also within one of the members of the above mentioned group.\n  [0029]  Examples of suitable excipients for pharmaceutical compositions of the invention comprising febuxostat are given in  US2005/0043375A1 , which is herein incorporated by reference, in paragraphs [0027] to [0030]. The excipients are typically contained in an amount of 50 to 98 parts by weight, and more preferably 60 to 95 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the solid preparation.\n  [0030]  In paragraph [0028]  US2005/0043375A1  discloses examples of the disintegrating agent for the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprising febuxostat. The disclosed disintegrants, which can also be used for the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, include carmellose sodium, carmellose calcium, low-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, crosscarmellose sodium, carboxymethyl starch sodium and crosspovidone. Preferred disintegrants and preferred amounts for the disintegrating agent to be used in the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention are also disclosed in paragraph [0028] of  US2005/0043375A1 .\n  [0031]  In paragraph [0029]  US2005/0043375A1  discloses examples of additional excipients to be added in the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions comprising febuxostat, such as binders, lubricants, coating agents, plasticizers, diluents, colorants, preservatives, antiseptics or fragrance agents, which are also useful for the preparation of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention.\n  [0032]  In paragraph [0030]  US2005/0043375A1  discloses examples of binders for the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, such as hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxy propylmethyl cellulose, and polyvinyl pyrrolidone. The binder is contained in an amount of 0.5 to 25 parts by weight, and preferably 1 to 20 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention.\n  [0033]  Examples of suitable processes for the preparation of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are given in  US2005/0043375A1 , which is herein incorporated by reference, in paragraphs [0031] to [0033]. In summary the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are preferably solid preparations which can be produced by compressing a mixture of form I of the present invention with excipients and disintegrating agents. For example, one method for the production of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention includes mixing form I of the present invention with suitable excipients in a suitable mixer. The mixture can then be directly compressed to tablets. Alternatively, a dry granulation step can be employed so as to produce granules suitable for tablet production. A wet granulation step can be employed to produce granules suitable for tablet production, in which step water, ethanol and solutions containing binders can be used.\n  [0034]  Specific examples for the production of tablets of the present invention are given in  US2005/0043375A1 , paragraphs [0034] to [0048]. These examples can be repeated using form I of the present invention instead of the crystals of febuxostat referred to in  US2005/0043375A1 , paragraphs [0034] to [0048].\n  [0035]  The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention comprising the crystalline form I of Febuxostat are preferably packaged or filled into containers. Containers are typically used for stable storage of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, for example at room temperature, such as at a temperature of about 20\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C, e.g. at about 25\u00b0C, for a prolonged period, e.g. for at least 6 months, preferably at least about 24 months, e.g. for up to at least 24 months, e.g. for up to at least about 30 months, such as for up to about 60 months.\n  [0036]  A preferred container is a bottle, in particular a glass bottle, having e.g. a screw closure, or is a blister, e.g. an aluminum blister or strip, e.g. a blister consisting of 2 aluminum foils or strips, or may be any other suitable container. More preferably said container is a gas-tight container, such as an air-tight container.\n  [0037]  Preferred containers are glass bottles sealed with an aluminum membrane, alu-alu-blisters or strips. The container according to the invention is obtained by filling the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention into said container.\n  [0038]  The present invention also relates to the use of crystalline form I of Febuxostat for the production of a pharmaceutical composition, in particular a pharmaceutical composition intended for sale in a tropical country having areas with an Af or Am climate according to the K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification.\n  [0039]  In a second aspect, the present invention relates to a further novel form of Febuxostat (hereinafter referred to as form II).\n  [0040]  Form II of Febuxostat can be characterized by an XRPD pattern comprising peaks at 2-theta angles of 2.9 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0, 5.8 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0, 12.0 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0, 12.3 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0 and 25.2 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0.\n  [0041]  Alternatively form II of Febuxostat can be described by an IR spectrum comprising peaks at wavenumbers of 2960 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 2874 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 2537 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 2229 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 684 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 656 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 1605 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 1510 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 1428 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 1371 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 326 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 1280 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 1173 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 1115 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 1043 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 1008 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 958 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 915\u00b1 2 cm-1, 827 \u00b1 2 cm-1, 765 \u00b1 2 cm-1 and 725 \u00b1 2 cm-1.\n  [0042]  The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of form II of Febuxostat comprising the steps of:\n a) dissolving Febuxostat in nitromethane; b) allowing form II of febuxostat to crystallize; c) recovering crystalline form II of Febuxostat from the solution; and d) optionally drying the form II crystals.  \n  [0043]  Typically any form of Febuxostat including amorphous Febuxostat is dissolved in nitromethane preferably at elevated temperature, e.g. at 40\u00b0C up to the boiling point of the solvent whereas form II is formed upon cooling. In a preferred embodiment the solution is cooled to a temperature of 10\u00b0 to -10\u00b0C, preferably +5\u00b0 to 0\u00b0C quickly, e.g. by placing the solution in an icebath.\n  [0044]  Form I may be isolated by conventional methods, e.g. by filtration and drying, e.g. in vacuo. Form II of Febuxostat is stable under ambient laboratory conditions, e.g. it does not convert to another polymorphic form when stored e.g. at ambient temperature for 6 weeks.\n  [0045]  Form II of Febuxostat is a valuable intermediate for the manufacture of form I of Febuxostat. Form II of Febuxostat may be transformed to form I of Febuxostat according to the processes disclosed for form I production above.\n  [0046]  In a third aspect the present invention refers to a novel crystalline tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat.\n  [0047]  The novel crystalline tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat can be characterized by an XRPD pattern comprising peaks at 2-theta angles of 6.1 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0, 8.6 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0, 11.4 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0, 17.3 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0 and 25.3 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0.\n  [0048]  The tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat contains about 0.4 mol to 0.6 mol of tert.-amylalcohol. TGA shows for example a mass loss of about 13.2 % corresponding to 0.55 mol tert.-amylalcohol per mol of Febuxostat.\n  [0049]  In another embodiment the present invention therefore relates to a process for the preparation of the tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat comprising the step of:\n a) dissolving Febuxostat in tert.-amylalcohol; b) concentrating the solution of step a) by evaporating the solvent, thereby allowing the tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat to crystallize; and c) recovering the tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat.  \n  [0050]  The amount of tert.-amylalcohol in the process for the preparation of the novel solvate is not critical, however a solution of Febuxostat in tert.-amylalcohol has to be ensured, optionally with the help of a filtration step.\n  [0051]  The tert.-amylalcohol solvate is stable, e.g. when stored under ambient conditions in open atmosphere for several weeks, e.g. for 5 weeks.\n  [0052]  The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of form I of Febuxostat from the tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat comprising the steps of:\n a) heating the tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat; and b) recovering form I of Febuxostat.  \n  [0053]  The tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat is a valuable intermediate for the manufacture of form I of Febuxostat. The tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat may be transformed to form I of Febuxostat according to the process disclosed for form I production starting from tert.-amylalcohol solvate of Febuxostat above.\n  [0054]  Typically the tert.-amylalcohol solvate is heated to a temperature range of 130 \u00b0C to 180 \u00b0C, preferably to 140 \u00b0C to 160 \u00b0C for a certain period of time. Typically dependent on the temperature several minutes to several hours are required to complete the transformation, e.g. at a temperature of about 150 \u00b0C the transformation is complete in less than 6 hours. The transformation may be monitored by classical methods, e.g. XRPD analysis. At lower temperatures, a desolvated intermediate is formed.\n  [0055]  Other objects, features, advantages and aspects of the present invention will become apparent to those of skill from the following description. It should be understood, however, that the description and the following specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only. Various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the disclosed invention will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from reading the description and the other parts of the present disclosure.\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n [0056]  XRPD patterns were obtained with an X'Pert PRO diffractometer (PANalytical, Almelo, The Netherlands) equipped with a theta/theta coupled goniometer in transmission geometry, programmable XYZ stage with well plate holder, Cu-K\u03b11,2 radiation source (wavelength 0.15419 nm) with a focusing mirror, a 0.5\u00b0 divergence slit, a 0.02\u00b0 soller slit collimator and a 1\u00b0 anti-scattering slit on the incident beam side, a 2 mm anti-scattering slit, a 0.02\u00b0 soller slit collimator and a Nickel filter on the diffracted beam side and a solid state PIXcel detector. The patterns were recorded at a tube voltage of 40 kV, tube current of 40 mA, applying a stepsize of 0.013\u00b0 2-theta with 80 s per step in the angular range of 2\u00b0 to 40\u00b0 2-theta.\n  [0057]  The IR spectra were collected on a MKII Golden Gate\u2122 Single Reflection Diamond ATR (attenuated total reflection) cell with a Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR spectrometer with 4 cm-1 resolution at ambient conditions. To collect a spectrum a spatula tip of a sample was applied to the surface of the diamond in powder form. Then the sample was pressed onto the diamond with a sapphire anvil and the spectrum was recorded. A spectrum of the clean diamond was used as background spectrum. A typical precision of the wavenumber values is in the range of about \u00b1 2 cm-1. Thus, an infrared peak that appears at 1716 cm-1 can appear between 1714 and 1718 cm-1 on most infrared spectrometers under standard conditions.\n  [0058]  TGA's were performed with Thermogravimetric-system TGA-7, Pyris-Software for Windows NT, (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, Ct., USA), Platinum-sample holder (50 \u00b5l), Nitrogen as the purge gas (Sample purge: 20 ml/min, balance purge: 40 ml/min).

In the experiments displayed in figure 8 and figure 9 the measurement cycle was started at 0 % RH, increased in 10 % steps up to 90 % RH and decreased in 10 % steps down to 0 % RH. The equilibrium condition for each step was set to a mass constancy of \u00b1 0.01 % over 30 min. The temperature was 25 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b0C.\n  Example 1: Preparation of Febuxostat form II\n [0060]  1.0 g of form A of 2-(3-cyano-4-isobutyloxyphenyl)-4-methyl-5-thiazolecarboxylic acid (Febuxostat) were dissolved in 120 ml nitromethane upon heating to 75 \u00b0C. The clear solution was filtered through a 0.44 \u00b5m milipore filter. The solution was then quickly cooled in an icebath and the suspension was stirred in the icebath for further 30 min. The crystals were filtered off and dried in vacuo for 3h at about 60 mbar.\n  [0061]  Yield: 820 mg\n Table 1: XRPD angles 2-theta, relative intensities of form II of Febuxostat            angle   rel intensity   angle   rel intensity     [2-Theta]\u00b0   [%]   [2-Theta]\u00b0   [%]      2,89 100 14,64 5   4,07 5 17,47 6   5,83 14 17,83 6   7,36 5 23,73 5   7,87 5 24,34 12   8,76 6 25,22 17   10,17 5 26,01 7   11,99 14 27,28 5   12,26 34 29,47 3   13,40 7 29,78 2      \n  [0062]  Form II of Febuxostat can be classified as non hygroscopic.

        "description": "This application is the U.S. national phase of International Patent Application No. PCT/US2012/035263, filed Apr. 26, 2012, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 611479,658, filed Apr. 27, 2011, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\nThe present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of regadenoson, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and hydrates thereof, and for the preparation of intermediates useful in the synthesis of regadenoson. The present invention also relates to a new crystalline form of regadenoson. Processes for the preparation of the crystalline form, compositions containing the crystalline form, and methods of use thereof are also described.\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\nRegadenoson [(1-{9-[(4S,2R,3R,5R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)oxalan-2-yl]-6-aminopurin-2-yl}pyrazol-4-yl)-N-methylcarboxamine] is a selective A2A-adenosine receptor agonist that is a coronary vasodilator. It is currently marketed in the form of a monohydrate as a pharmacologic stress agent indicated for radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in patients unable to undergo adequate exercise stress.\nU.S. Pat. No. 8,106,183 describes amorphous regadenoson, and three forms of regadenoson, referred to as Form A (a monohydrate), Form B and Form C.\nThe synthesis of regadenoson is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,403,567 and 7,183,264. The syntheses disclosed are multi-step processes that proceed via 2-hydrazinoadenosine, which is prepared from the corresponding iodo-derivative (2-iodoadenosine). Although these methods are suited to small scale syntheses, they are not well suited for large scale syntheses. Moreover, the yields are low and the staining nature of iodine makes the purification of the 2-iodoadenosine intermediate problematic. It is desirable, therefore, to find new methods of synthesis that provide a convenient method for making large quantities of the material in good yield and high purity.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nThe present inventors have found that regadenoson, and hydrates thereof (such as regadenoson monohydrate) may be prepared in high purity and high yield in one step using a 2-haloadenosine (e.g., 2-fluoroadenosine) as a starting material. The present inventors surprisingly found that 2-hydrazinoadenosine may be prepared from 2-fluoroadenosine in higher yield and at higher conversion rate than from the corresponding 2-iodo or 2-chloroadenosine derivatives.\nIn one aspect, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of regadenoson, derivatives thereof, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and hydrates thereof, which comprises contacting a 2-haloadenosine with a 4-N-alkylcarboxamide pyrazole (e.g., 4-N-methylcarboxamide pyrazole) or a 4-carboxylate pyrazole in the presence of a metal catalyst and a base.\nThus, in one aspect, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a compound of Formula (I), and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and hydrates thereof:\n              \ncomprising contacting a compound of Formula (II) with a compound of Formula (III) in the presence of a metal catalyst and a base\n\n              \nwherein R is C1-6 alkyl (e.g., C1-4 alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, isproppyl); and\n  X is a halogen, such as F, Cl, Br or I. \nThe compound of Formula (I) may be converted to regadenoson by aminating the carboxylate group of the compound (e.g., by reaction with methylamine)\nIn a preferred aspect, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of regadenoson, and hydrates thereof, which comprises contacting 2-fluoroadenosine with 4-N-methylcarboxamide pyrazole in the presence of a metal catalyst and a base.\nIn another aspect, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 2-hydrazinoadenosine comprising contacting 2-fluoroadenosine or 2-bromoadenosine with hydrazine. In a preferred embodiment, 2-fluoroadenosine is reacted with hydrazine. The 2-hydrazinoadenosine may further be converted to regadenoson, or a hydrate thereof.\nIn yet another aspect, the invention relates to a process for the purification of regadenoson (for example, regadenoson prepared by a method described herein) by subjecting the regadenoson to reverse phase chromatography. The column can be eluted with a water/alcohol (preferably water/methanol).\nIn yet another aspect, the invention relates to regadenoson having at least 98% purity (e.g., at least 99% or at least 99.5% purity) and comprising 2-fluoroadenosine in an amount up to about 0.2%, based upon the total weight of the regadenoson. The regadenoson may be incorporated into a pharmaceutical composition, such as a parenteral solution.\nIn yet another aspect, the invention relates to a composition comprising (a) regadenoson, and (b) 2-fluoroadenosine in an amount up to about 0.2%, based upon the total weight of the composition. The composition can be a pharmaceutical composition, such as a parenteral solution.\nIn yet another aspect, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising regadenoson made by a process of the present invention.\nThe present inventors have also discovered a new crystalline form of regadenoson, referred to herein as Form D. Thus, in a further aspect, the present invention relates to a novel crystalline form of regadenoson. In another aspect, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of the new crystalline form. In certain embodiments, the new crystalline form may be prepared by a process that does not involve isolating any intermediate regadenoson compound. In additional aspects, the present invention relates to compositions containing the crystalline form, and to methods of use thereof.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n FIG. 1 is a 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of regadenoson monohydrate.\n FIG. 2 is a High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) trace for regadenoson monohydrate.\n FIG. 3 is an HPLC trace for the formation of 2-hydrazinoadenosine (A) by reaction of hydrazine with a 1:1:1 mixture of 2-fluoroadenosine (B), 2-chloroadenosine (C) and 2-iodoadenosine (D).\n FIG. 4 is an X-ray powder diffraction pattern of Form D of regadenoson.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\nImproved Processes for the Preparation of Regadenoson and Derivatives Thereof and Hydrates Thereof\nIn one aspect, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a compound of Formula (I), and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and hydrates thereof:\n              \ncomprising contacting a compound of Formula (II) with a compound of Formula (III) in the presence of a metal catalyst and a base\n\n              \nwherein R is C1-6 alkyl (e.g., C1-4 alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl); and\n  X is a halogen, such as F, Cl, Br or I. \nIn a preferred embodiment, X is F. In another embodiment, R is methyl.\nIn one embodiment, the process further comprises converting the compound of formula (I) to a compound of Formula (IV)\n              \nwherein R2 is C1-6 alkyl (e.g., C1-4 alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl).\n\nFor example, the compound of Formula (I) may be converted to a compound of Formula (IV) by reaction with a primary amine, such as a C1-6 alkylamine (e.g., methyl amine).\nIn another aspect, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of regadenoson of Formula (IA), pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and hydrates thereof:\n              \nwhich comprises contacting 2-fluoroadenosine of Formula (IIA) with 4-N-methylcarboxamide pyrazole of Formula (IIIA) in the presence of a metal catalyst and a base.\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the reaction is conducted in a polar solvent. For example, the solvent may be an organic solvent that is miscible with DMSO, such as acetonitrile, dimethylsulfoxide, dimethyl formamide, dichloroethane, dichloromethane, methanol, ethanol, and mixtures thereof. In certain embodiments, the reaction is conducted in a mixture (for example a 1:2 mixture) of dimethylsulfoxide and acetonitrile. In some embodiments, the solvent is dimethylsulfoxide containing from about 10% to about 50% acetonitrile, for example, dimethylsulfoxide containing about 25% acetonitrile.\nIn additional embodiments, the base has a pK of at least 8 (e.g., a pK of from about 9 to about 12). For example, the base may be selected from sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, triethylamine, cyclic amidine bases (such as, e.g., 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) or 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO)) and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the base is DBU. In another embodiment, the base is DABCO. In certain embodiments, the amount of base is about 3 equivalents, based on the amount of compound of formula (II). In further embodiments, the metal catalyst is a copper catalyst. For example, the metal catalyst is a copper (II) catalyst. In one embodiment, the copper (II) catalyst is chelated to a resin, for example, a resin attached to iminodiacetic acid. In certain embodiments, the amount of catalyst is about 0.1 equivalent, based on the amount of compound of formula (II).\nIn further embodiments, the reaction is conducted at a temperature of between about 60\u00b0 C. and about 90\u00b0 C., for example between about 70\u00b0 C. and about 85\u00b0 C., such as at about 80\u00b0 C.\nIn additional embodiments, the reaction proceeds for between about 12 and about 24 hours, such as between about 12 and about 18 hours.\nIn certain embodiments, the regadenoson is in the form of a hydrate, for example a monohydrate.\n FIGS. 1 and 2, respectively, depict the 1H NMR spectrum (DMSO-d6) and HPLC trace of regadenoson monohydrate, prepared according to a process of the present invention.\nIn further embodiments, the regadenoson, pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or hydrate thereof, is greater than about 75% pure, for example, greater than about 80% pure, greater than about 85% pure, greater than about 90% pure, greater than about 95% pure, greater than about 97.5% pure, greater than about 99% pure, greater than about 99.5% pure or greater than about 99.9% pure.\nIn additional embodiments, the process further comprises converting regadenoson, or a hydrate thereof, to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Acid addition salts may be prepared in a standard manner in a suitable solvent from the parent compound and an excess of acid, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, maleic, succinic, methanesulfonic, and the like. Cationic salts may be prepared by reaction with an excess of an alkaline reagent, such as hydroxide, carbonate or alkoxide, containing the appropriate cation. Cations such as Na+, K+ and Ca+2 are examples of cations present in pharmaceutically acceptable salts.\nIn another aspect, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 2-hydrazinoadenosine of Formula (V):\n              \ncomprising contacting 2-fluoroadenosine or 2-bromoadenosine with hydrazine.\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, 2-fluoroadenosine is reacted with hydrazine. In certain embodiments, a molar excess of 2-fluoroadenosine is used. In some embodiments, the molar excess of hydrazine to 2-fluoroadenosine is from about 1.5 to about 20, such as from about 2 to about 12, from about 3 to about 6. In one embodiment, the molar excess of hydrazine to 2-fluoroadenosine is about a 3 molar excess.\nIn certain embodiments, the reaction is conducted in a polar solvent. For example, the solvent may be an organic solvent that is miscible with DMSO, such as acetonitrile, dimethylsulfoxide, dimethyl formamide, dichloroethane, dichloromethane, methanol, ethanol, and mixtures thereof. For example, in one embodiment, the solvent is dimethylsulfoxide containing from about 10% to about 50% acetonitrile.\nIn further embodiments, the reaction is conducted at a temperature of between about 60\u00b0 C. and about 90\u00b0 C., for example between about 70\u00b0 C. and about 85\u00b0 C., such as at about 75\u00b0 C.\n FIG. 3 shows a HPLC vs. time trace for reaction of a 1:1:1 mixture of 2-fluoro, 2-chloro- and 2-iodoadenosine with 18 equivalents of hydrazine in dimethylsulfoxide at 75\u00b0 C. The inventors surprisingly found that the 2-fluoroadenosine was completely converted to 2-hydrazineadeonsine within 5 hours at 75\u00b0 C. In contrast, the corresponding 2-iodoadensoinse derivative achieved only 50% conversion to 2-hydrazineadeonsine, and the 2-chlorodensoinse achieved only 20% conversion to 2-hydrazineadeonsine under the same reaction conditions.\nIn certain embodiments, the process further comprises converting 2-hydrazinoadenosine of Formula (V) to regadenoson, or a hydrate thereof.\nFor example, the 2-hydrazinoadenosine of Formula (V) may be contacted with a compound of formula [R\u2032C(O)CH(CO2R)C(O)R\u2033] to afford a compound of Formula (I):\n              \nin which R is C1-6 alkyl and R\u2032 and R\u2033 are, independently, hydrogen, C1-6 alkyl or aryl, with the proviso that at least one of R\u2032 and R\u2033 is hydrogen. In one embodiment, R\u2032 and R\u2033 are both hydrogen. The compound of Formula (I) may be further converted to regadenoson. In an exemplary embodiment, the 2-hydrazinoadenosine of Formula (V) may be contacted with ethyl 2-formyl-3-oxopropionate [HC(O)CH(CO2Et)C(O)H] to afford\n\n              \nwhich may subsequently be converted to regadenoson, or a hydrate thereof, by contacting it with methylamine, according to the procedures outlined, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,403,567, 7,183,264 and 7,732,595, as shown below:\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nRegadenoson can be purified by any method known in the art. Applicants have discovered that one particularly effective method of purification is by subjecting the regadenoson to reverse phase chromatography. The column can be eluted with water/alcohol (preferably water/methanol). For example, the regadenoson can be dissolved in 1:1 mixture of DMSO and methanol, loaded to a reverse phase column, and eluted with water/methanol (gradient with a 5% increase of MeOH). The fractions with the desired HPLC purity, for example, with 99.9% or greater purity, can be combined, filtered and dried (e.g., in a vacuum oven). The reverse phase chromatography can be repeated on fractions have a purity of 99.8% or lower (for example, a purity of between 50% and 99.8%).\nPrior to (or alternatively to) performing the reverse phase chromatography, the regadenoson may undergo one or more purification steps, such as (a) filtering, (b) co-evaporation with xylene, and (c) precipitation (for example, from acetonitrile) followed by filtration.\nNew Crystalline Form of Regadenoson (Form D)\nIn another aspect, the present invention provides a novel crystalline form of regadenoson which can be identified by one or more analytical methods. Form D is stable under inert conditions. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern of the crystalline form (Form D) is provided in FIG. 4.\nIn a further embodiment, the crystalline form of regadenoson (Form D) is characterized by a X-ray powder diffraction pattern substantially as shown in FIG. 4. With respect to the term \u201csubstantially,\u201d one skilled in the art would understand that the relative intensities of the peaks can vary, depending upon the sample preparation technique, the sample mounting procedure and the particular instrument employed.\nIn another embodiment, the crystalline form of regadenoson (Form D) contains between about 0.8 and about 1.7% by weight of water of hydration.\nForm D of regadenoson can be in solid form (such as a powder) which is useful for preparing solutions containing regadenoson, such as a parenteral formulation of regadenoson.\nIn one embodiment, the invention provides a composition comprising Form D of regadenoson. In another embodiment, the invention provides a composition comprising Form D of regadenoson and one or more other solid state forms of regadenoson, such as Form A, B or C of regadenoson.\nThe crystalline form of regadenoson (Form D) of the invention can be administered alone or as an active ingredient of a formulation. Thus, the present invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions of the crystalline form of regadenoson (Form D) containing, for example, one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers.\nCompositions\nParenteral solutions may be prepared, for example, by dissolving regadenoson (such as Form D of regadenoson, or regadenoson made by a process of the present invention) in an aqueous solution (such as saline) and optionally adding one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Thus, in another aspect, the present invention relates to a method of preparing a parenteral solution of regadenoson comprising (i) dissolving (a) Form D of regadenoson, or (b) regadenoson made by a process of the present invention, in an aqueous solution and (ii) optionally adding one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.\nNumerous standard references are available that describe procedures for preparing various formulations suitable for administering regadenoson, including Form D of regadenoson and regadenoson made by a process of the present invention. Examples of potential formulations and preparations are contained, for example, in the Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, American Pharmaceutical Association (fifth edition); Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets (Lieberman, Lachman and Schwartz, editors) third edition, published by Marcel Dekker, Inc.; as well as Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Arthur Osol, editor), (seventeenth edition).\nAdministration of the regadenoson (such as Form D of regadenoson) may be accomplished according to patient needs, for example, orally, nasally, parenterally (subcutaneously, intraveneously, intramuscularly, intrasternally and by infusion), by inhalation, rectally, vaginally, topically and by ocular administration.\nVarious solid oral dosage forms can be used for administering the regadenoson (such as Form D of regadenoson) including such solid forms as tablets, gelcaps, capsules, caplets, granules, lozenges and bulk powders. The regadenoson can be administered alone or combined with various pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents (such as sucrose, mannitol, lactose, and starches) and excipients known in the art, including, but not limited, to suspending agents, solubilizers, buffering agents, binders, disintegrants, preservatives, colorants, flavorants, lubricants and the like. Time release capsules, tablets and gels are also advantageous in administering the compounds of the present invention.\nSuppositories for rectal administration of the regadenoson (such as Form D of regadenoson) can be prepared by mixing the compound with a suitable excipient such as cocoa butter, salicylates and polyethylene glycols. Formulations for vaginal administration can be in the form of a pessary, tampon, cream, gel, past foam, or spray formula containing, in addition to the active ingredient, such suitable carriers as are known in the art.\nFor topical administration, the pharmaceutical composition can be in the form of creams, ointments, liniments, lotions, emulsions, suspensions, gels, solutions, pastes, powders, sprays, and drops suitable for administration to the skin, eye, ear or nose. Topical administration may also involve transdermal administration via means such as transdermal patches.\nAerosol formulations suitable for administering via inhalation also can be made. For example, for treatment of disorders of the respiratory tract, the compounds according to the invention can be administered by inhalation in the form of a powder (e.g., micronized) or in the form of atomized solutions or suspensions. The aerosol formulation can be placed into a pressurized acceptable propellant.\nMethods of Treatment\nThe present invention further provides methods for treating a condition which requires modulation of an adenosine receptor, e.g., an A2A receptor. The methods involve administering a therapeutically effective amount of (i) regadenoson of the present invention (e.g., Form D of regadenoson, or regadenoson made by a process of the present invention) or (ii) a regadenoson formulation (such as a parenteral solution) prepared from regadenoson of the present invention, to a patient in need thereof. One embodiment is a method of stimulating coronary vasodilation, producing coronary vasodilation.\nIn additional embodiments, the present invention provides methods of myocardial perfusion imaging that involve administering (i) regadenoson of the present invention or (ii) a regadenoson formulation (such as a parenteral solution) prepared from regadenoson of the present invention, and a radionuclide.\nIn some embodiments, the compound or composition of the present invention is administered as a mono-therapy.

Chelex 100 resin is available from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, Calif.). The HPLC method for the preparation of N-methyl-4-carboxamide and regadenoson was carried out on an Altima C18 column, 5\u03bc, 4.6 mm\u00d7250 mm, using a gradient of 2-70% over 15 min of Buffer B (Buffer A=0.1% triethylamine/0.1% Acetic Acid/3% acetonitrile by volume in DI water, pH \u02dc4.5; Buffer B=10% Buffer A in acetonitrile). The purification of crude regadenoson was carried out on a reverse phase resin using a gradient of 0-70% methanol/water.\nX-Ray Powder Diffractions analysis was performed using a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer. The x-ray generator employed a Cu tube operated at 40 kV. The experimental conditions were as follows: Bragg-Brentano focusing method geometry; Incident and receiving Soller slits=5 degrees; divergent and scattered slits=2/3 degree; divergent height limiting slit=10 mm; receiving slit=0.3 mm; scan speed=0.2 degrees/minute; sampling width=0.02 degree; scintillation detector with monochromator.\nExample 1\nSynthesis of N-Methyl-4-carboxamide\n20 g (143 mmol, 1 equiv) of ethyl pyrazole-4-carboxylate and 200 mL (2310 mmol, 16.2 equiv) of a 40% aqueous solution of methylamine were added to a three-necked flask equipped with a condenser and a heating mantle. The mixture was stirred to aid dissolution, and heated to 65\u00b0 C. for 2 hours. The reaction was monitored using HPLC at 220 nm with a C18 column. The reaction mixture was then concentrated in vacuo to obtain a syrup/solid. The crude product was co-evaporated with acetonitrile (3\u00d7200 mL). 100 mL of acetonitrile was then added to the solids and the mixture was stirred for several hours until the solids were well suspended. The solids were then isolated by filtration, washed with 100 mL acetonitrile, and dried in an oven at 40\u00b0 C. to afford 14.4 g (80% yield) of N-methyl-4-carboxamide with a purity of 93.5% by HPLC.\nExample 2\nSynthesis of IDAAR-Cu+2  \nThis preparation has reported in the literature. See, e.g., Chinese Chemical Letters, (21(1), 51-54, 2010.\nAn Erlenmeyer flask was charged with 350 mL of water and 75 g of Chelex 100 resin. With stirring, an aqueous solution of copper sulfate pentahydrate (59 g in 350 mL of water) was slowly added over a period of 15 minutes. The resulting slurry was stirred for 2 hours, then filtered. The resulting solids were washed with 100-200 mL of water and dried in a vacuum oven at 50\u00b0 C. for 16 hours to afford 18 g of IDAAR-Cu+2. The copper content of the product was determined to be 11 wt % using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES).\nExample 3\nSynthesis of Regadenoson Monohydrate\n5 g (17.5 mmol, 1 equiv) of 2-fluoroadenosine, 3.07 g (24.5 mmol, 1.4 equiv) of N-methylpyrazole-4-carboxamide, and 32 mL of dimethylsulfoxide were added under a nitrogen atmosphere to a dry 3-necked reaction flask equipped with a condenser and a heating mantle. The mixture was stirred to afford a solution. 100 mL of acetonitrile was then added followed by the addition of 2.2 g of IDAAR-Cu2+ and 5.34 g (5.24 mL, 35.1 mmol, 2 equiv) of diazabicycloundecene (DBU). The reaction mixture was heated to 70-80\u00b0 C. overnight and monitored by HPLC at 260 nm with a C18 column until the reaction was complete. Then, the reaction mixture was evaporated in vacuo to remove most of the acetonitrile. The remaining dimethylsufoxide solution was purified by reverse phase chromatography using methanol and water. The product was dried in vacuo at a temperature that did not exceed 40\u00b0 C. to afford 3 g (44% yield) of regadenoson monohydrate.\nExample 4\nSynthesis of 2-Hydazineadenosine\n2-fluoroadenosine (4 g, 14 mmol) was dissolved in 100 mL ethanol in a 300 mL three-necked flask. Hydrazine hydrate (4.1 mL, 6 equivalents, 84 mmol) was added and the mixture was heated to reflux for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature and stirred overnight (16 hours). The resulting white precipitate was isolated by filtration and dried in oven at 40\u00b0 C. overnight to afford 2-hydrazinoadenosine (yield: 94%, 3.5 g, 96% purity).\nExample 5\nSynthesis of Regadenoson Form D\n2-Fluoroadenosine (45 g, 0.158 mol., 1 eq.), 4-(N-methylcarboxamido)pyrazole (27.64 g, 0.221 mol., 1.4 eq.), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (320 mL) and acetonitrile (960 mL) were added to a dry 3000 ml 3-neck reaction flask equipped with a condenser and heating mantle. After stirring for 10 minutes, IDAAR-Cu (20.07 g, 0.032 mol., 0.2 eq.) and DBU (48.0 g, 0.316 mol., 2 eq.) were added. The resulting mixture was then heated to 65\u00b0 C. overnight (18 hours).\nThe reaction mixture was then filtered and the filtrate was evaporated followed by 2\u00d7500 mL co-evaporation with xylene. The residue was diluted with 5 L acetonitrile, transferred to a 10 L flask and kept in a cold room (4\u00b0 C.) overnight. The resulting white precipitate was isolated by filtration and stirred in 1.8 L of water. The mixture was heated to 80\u00b0 C. for 2 hours, then allowed to cool in a cold room (4\u00b0 C.) overnight.\nThe white precipitate was isolated by filtration, then dissolved in 200 ml of 1:1 mixture of DMSO and methanol. The clear and slightly yellow solution was loaded to a reverse phase column (10 L) and eluted with water/methanol (gradient with a 5% increase of MeOH every 10 L).\nThe fractions with HPLC purity of more than 99.9% were combined and concentrated to a paste. The supernatant liquid was decanted and the flask heated in an oil-bath at 150\u00b0 C. under reduced pressure of 20 mmHg for 6 hours to afford 6.2 g of Regadenoson Form D as white solid (99.94% HPLC, KF analysis 0.8%).\nThe fractions with HPLC purity between 50 and 99.8% (\u02dc23 g of product as indicated by HPLC) were combined and subjected to a second purification stage.\nThe present invention is not to be limited in scope by the specific embodiments described herein.

        "description": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\nThis patent application is a national stage filing under 35 U.S.C. 371 of International Application No. PCT/GB2008/003510, filed on Oct. 17, 2008, which claims priority benefits to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/980,508, filed on Oct. 17, 2007. These applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.\nThe present invention relates to a crystalline form and pharmaceutical compositions and uses of the crystalline form.\nThe mammalian enzyme PARP (a 113-kDa multidomain protein) has been implicated in the signalling of DNA damage through its ability to recognize and rapidly bind to DNA single or double strand breaks (D'Amours, et al., Biochem. J., 342, 249-268 (1999)).\nSeveral observations have led to the conclusion that PARP participates in a variety of DNA-related functions including gene amplification, cell division, differentiation, apoptosis, DNA base excision repair and also effects on telomere length and chromosome stability (d'Adda di Fagagna, et al., Nature Gen., 23(1), 76-80 (1999)).\nStudies on the mechanism by which PARP modulates DNA repair and other processes has identified its importance in the formation of poly (ADP-ribose) chains within the cellular nucleus (Althaus, F. R. and Richter, C., ADP-Ribosylation of Proteins: Enzymology and Biological Significance, Springer-Verlag, Berlin (1987)). The DNA-bound, activated PARP utilizes NAD to synthesize poly (ADP-ribose) on a variety of nuclear target proteins, including topoisomerase, histones and PARP itself (Rhun, et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 245, 1-10 (1998))\nPoly (ADP-ribosyl)ation has also been associated with malignant transformation. For example, PARP activity is higher in the isolated nuclei of SV40-transformed fibroblasts, while both leukemic cells and colon cancer cells show higher enzyme activity than the equivalent normal leukocytes and colon mucosa (Miwa, et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 181, 313-321 (1977); Burzio, et al., Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med., 149, 933-938 (1975); and Hirai, et al., Cancer Res., 43, 3441-3446 (1983)).\nA number of low-molecular-weight inhibitors of PARP have been used to elucidate the functional role of poly (ADP-ribosyl)ation in DNA repair. In cells treated with alkylating agents, the inhibition of PARP leads to a marked increase in DNA-strand breakage and cell killing (Durkacz, et al., Nature, 283, 593-596 (1980); Berger, N. A., Radiation Research, 101, 4-14 (1985)).\nSubsequently, such inhibitors have been shown to enhance the effects of radiation response by suppressing the repair of potentially lethal damage (Ben-Hur, et al., British Journal of Cancer, 49 (Suppl. VI), 34-42 (1984); Schlicker, et al., Int. J. Radiat. Bioi., 75, 91-100 (1999)). PARP inhibitors have been reported to be effective in radio sensitising hypoxic tumour cells (U.S. Pat. No. 5,032,617; U.S. Pat. No. 5,215,738 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,041,653).\nFurthermore, PARP knockout (PARP \u2212/\u2212) animals exhibit genomic instability in response to alkylating agents and \u03b3-irradiation (Wang, et al., Genes Dev., 9, 509-520 (1995); Menissier de Murcia, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 94, 7303-7307 (1997)).\nA role for PARP has also been demonstrated in certain vascular diseases, septic shock, ischaemic injury and neurotoxicity (Cantoni, et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1014, 1-7 (1989); Szabo, et al., J. Clin. Invest., 100, 723-735 (1997)). Oxygen radical DNA damage that leads to strand breaks in DNA, which are subsequently recognised by PARP, is a major contributing factor to such disease states as shown by PARP inhibitor studies (Cosi, et al., J. Neurosci. Res., 39, 38-46 (1994); Said, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 93, 4688-4692 (1996)). More recently, PARP has been demonstrated to play a role in the pathogenesis of haemorrhagic shock (Liaudet, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 97(3), 10203-10208 (2000)).\nIt has also been demonstrated that efficient retroviral infection of mammalian cells is blocked by the inhibition of PARP activity. Such inhibition of recombinant retroviral vector infections was shown to occur in various different cell types (Gaken, et al., J. Virology, 70(6), 3992-4000 (1996)). Inhibitors of PARP have thus been developed for the use in anti-viral therapies and in cancer treatment (WO 91/18591).\nMoreover, PARP inhibition has been speculated to delay the onset of aging characteristics in human fibroblasts (Rattan and Clark, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm., 201(2), 665-672 (1994)). This may be related to the role that PARP plays in controlling telomere function (d'Adda di Fagagna, et al., Nature Gen., 23(1), 76-80 (1999)).\nWO 2004/080976 discloses a number of phthalazinone derivatives, their activity in inhibiting PARP, and their consequential use in treating cancer, whether as an adjunct to radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or as a stand alone agent.\nWO 2005/053662 describes the use of PARP inhibitors, in particular phthalazinone derivatives, as base excision repair (BER) inhibitors. The use of these inhibitors in the manufacture of medicaments for the treatment of cancers which are deficient in Homologous Recombination (HR) dependent DNA DSB repair activity, in particular for cancers which have a BRCA1 and/or a BRCA2 deficient phenotype, is described.\n4-[3-(4-Cyclopropanecarbonyl-piperazine-1-carbonyl)-4-fluoro-benzyl]-2H-phthalazin-1-one (compound A) disclosed in WO 2004/080976:\n              \nis of particular interest.\n\nA crystalline form of compound A (Form A) is disclosed in co-pending applications, which claim priority from U.S. 60/829,694, filed 17 Oct. 2006, entitled \u201cPhthalazinone Derivative\u201d, including U.S. Ser. No. 11/873,671 and WO 2008/047082.\nParticular forms of compound A may have advantageous properties, for example with regard to their solubility and/or their stability and/or their bioavailability and/or their impurity profile and/or their filtration characteristics and/or their drying characteristics and/or their lack of hygroscopicity, and/or they may be easier to handle and/or micronise and/or form into tablets.\nAccordingly, a first aspect of the present invention provides 4-[3-(4-cyclopropanecarbonyl-piperazine-1-carbonyl)-4-fluoro-benzyl]-2H-phthalazin-1-one (compound A) substantially as crystalline Form L.\n\u201cSubstantially as crystalline Form L\u201d as used above, means that at least 50% by weight of compound A as Form L, preferably at least 70% by weight, 80% or 90% by weight. In some embodiments, at least 95% by weight, 99% by weight or even 99.5% or more by weight may be in crystalline form.\nCompound A as crystalline Form L has an X-ray diffraction pattern (\u03bb=1.5418 \u212b) containing specific peaks at:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nPeak\n2\u03b8\u00b0 (\u00b10.1\u00b0)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n1\n14.4\n\n\n \n2\n17.2\n\n\n \n3\n17.5\n\n\n \n4\n18.8\n\n\n \n5\n23.0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound A as crystalline Form L may also have the following additional peaks in an X-ray diffraction pattern (\u03bb=1.5418 \u212b):\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nPeak\n2\u03b8\u00b0 (\u00b10.1\u00b0)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n6\n10.4\n\n\n \n7\n13.6\n\n\n \n8\n25.1\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound A as crystalline Form L may also be characterised by any combination of three or more peaks selected from the list of 8 peaks above.\nA representative powder XRD pattern of compound A in Form L is shown in FIG. 1.\nForm L of compound A is substantially free from solvent. The term \u201csubstantially free from solvent\u201d as used herein refers to the form having only insignificant amounts of any solvent, e.g. a form with a total of 0.5% by weight or less of any solvent. The total amount of any solvent may be 0.25%, 0.1%, 0.05% or 0.025% by weight or less.\nForm L of compound A may also be characterised using DSC. Form L of compound A when heated from 25\u00b0 C. to 325\u00b0 C. at 10\u00b0 C. per minute will have an onset of melting at 198.5\u00b0 C.\u00b11\u00b0 C. A representative DSC trace for compound A as Form L is shown in FIG. 2. The second endotherm corresponds to melting of Form A, to which the melted Form L transforms.\nThe second aspect of the present invention provides a method of obtaining 4-[3-(4-cyclopropanecarbonyl-piperazine-1-carbonyl)-4-fluoro-benzyl]-2H-phthalazin-1-one (compound A) as crystalline Form L from compound A as crystalline Form A.\nThis method involves slurrying compound A as either Form A or a mixture of Forms A and L in an organic solvent that may contain up to 30% water v/v. In some embodiments, the mixture may contain no Form L, or 99%, 90% or 80% as Form A. In other embodiments, the amount of Form L may be up to 50, 70 or even 80% of the mixture. In some embodiments, the organic solvent may contain no water. In other embodiments, the organic solvent may contain up to 25 or 20% water. The solvent may be selected from a solvent which gives sufficient solubility for a transformation to occur. In some embodiments, the solvent is selected from the group consisting of: methanol, ethanol, acetone, acetonitrile and nitromethane.\nThe slurrying may take place at a temperature up to the boiling point of the solvent, but may more usually be carried out at a temperature lower than that. In some embodiments, the slurrying takes place at between 20\u00b0 C. and 50\u00b0 C., or even 20\u00b0 C. and 40\u00b0 C., or 20\u00b0 C. and 30\u00b0 C. With lower temperatures, the slurrying time may be increased. Typically, the slurrying is carried out for at least 3 hours, at least 6 hours or even at least 24 hours. In some embodiments, the slurrying is carried out for at least 3 days, 4 days, a week or even 3 weeks.\nA third aspect of the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the first aspect and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.\nAn fourth aspect of the present invention provides a compound of the first aspect for use in a method of treatment of the human or animal body.\nA fifth aspect of the present invention provides the use of a compound as defined in the first aspect of the invention in the preparation of a medicament for inhibiting the activity of PARP.\nFurther aspects of the invention provide the use of a compound as defined in the first aspect of the invention in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of: vascular disease; septic shock; ischaemic injury; neurotoxicity; haemorraghic shock; viral infection; or diseases ameliorated by the inhibition of the activity of PARP.\nAnother further aspect of the invention provides for the use of a compound as defined in the first aspect of the invention in the preparation of a medicament for use as an adjunct in cancer therapy or for potentiating tumour cells for treatment with ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic agents.\nOther further aspects of the invention provide for the treatment of disease ameliorated by the inhibition of PARP, comprising administering to a subject in need of treatment a therapeutically-effective amount of a compound as defined in the first aspect, preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition and the treatment of cancer, comprising administering to a subject in need of treatment a therapeutically-effective amount of a compound as defined in the first aspect in combination, preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, simultaneously or sequentially with ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic agents.\nIn further aspects of the present invention, the compounds may be used in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of cancer which is deficient in Homologous Recombination (HR) dependent DNA DSB repair activity, or in the treatment of a patient of a cancer which is deficient in HR dependent DNA DSB repair activity, comprising administering to said patient a therapeutically-effective amount of the compound.\nThe HR dependent DNA DSB repair pathway repairs double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA via homologous mechanisms to reform a continuous DNA helix (K. K. Khanna and S. P. Jackson, Nat. Genet. 27(3): 247-254 (2001)). The components of the HR dependent DNA DSB repair pathway include, but are not limited to, ATM (NM\u2014000051), RAD51 (NM\u2014002875), RAD51L1 (NM\u2014002877), RAD51C(NM\u2014002876), RAD51L3 (NM\u2014002878), DMC1 (NM\u2014007068), XRCC2 (NM\u2014005431), XRCC3 (NM\u2014005432), RAD52 (NM\u2014002879), RAD54L (NM\u2014003579), RAD54B (NM\u2014012415), BRCA1 (NM\u2014007295), BRCA2 (NM\u2014000059), RAD50 (NM\u2014005732), MRE11A (NM\u2014005590) and NBS1 (NM\u2014002485). Other proteins involved in the HR dependent DNA DSB repair pathway include regulatory factors such as EMSY (Hughes-Davies, et al., Cell, 115, pp 523-535). HR components are also described in Wood, et al., Science, 291, 1284-1289 (2001).\nA cancer which is deficient in HR dependent DNA DSB repair may comprise or consist of one or more cancer cells which have a reduced or abrogated ability to repair DNA DSBs through that pathway, relative to normal cells i.e. the activity of the HR dependent DNA DSB repair pathway may be reduced or abolished in the one or more cancer cells.\nThe activity of one or more components of the HR dependent DNA DSB repair pathway may be abolished in the one or more cancer cells of an individual having a cancer which is deficient in HR dependent DNA DSB repair. Components of the HR dependent DNA DSB repair pathway are well characterised in the art (see for example, Wood, et al., Science, 291, 1284-1289 (2001)) and include the components listed above.\nIn some preferred embodiments, the cancer cells may have a BRCA1 and/or a BRCA2 deficient phenotype i.e. BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 activity is reduced or abolished in the cancer cells. Cancer cells with this phenotype may be deficient in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2, i.e. expression and/or activity of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 may be reduced or abolished in the cancer cells, for example by means of mutation or polymorphism in the encoding nucleic acid, or by means of amplification, mutation or polymorphism in a gene encoding a regulatory factor, for example the EMSY gene which encodes a BRCA2 regulatory factor (Hughes-Davies, et al., Cell, 115, 523-535).\nBRCA1 and BRCA2 are known tumour suppressors whose wild-type alleles are frequently lost in tumours of heterozygous carriers (Jasin M., Oncogene, 21(58), 8981-93 (2002); Tuft, et al., Trends Mol. Med., 8(12), 571-6, (2002)). The association of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutations with breast cancer is well-characterised in the art (Radice, P. J., Exp Clin Cancer Res., 21(3 Suppl), 9-12 (2002)). Amplification of the EMSY gene, which encodes a BRCA2 binding factor, is also known to be associated with breast and ovarian cancer.\nCarriers of mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 are also at elevated risk of cancer of the ovary, prostate and pancreas.\nIn some preferred embodiments, the individual is heterozygous for one or more variations, such as mutations and polymorphisms, in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 or a regulator thereof. The detection of variation in BRCA1 and BRCA2 is well-known in the art and is described, for example in EP 699 754, EP 705 903, Neuhausen, S. L. and Ostrander, E. A., Genet. Test, 1, 75-83 (1992); Chappnis, P. O. and Foulkes, W. D., Cancer Treat Res, 107, 29-59 (2002); Janatova M., et al., Neoplasma, 50(4), 246-50 (2003); Jancarkova, N., Ceska Gynekol., 68(1), 11-6 (2003)). Determination of amplification of the BRCA2 binding factor EMSY is described in Hughes-Davies, et al., Cell, 115, 523-535).\nMutations and polymorphisms associated with cancer may be detected at the nucleic acid level by detecting the presence of a variant nucleic acid sequenc or at the protein level by detecting the presence of a variant (i.e. a mutant or allelic variant) polypeptide.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES\n FIG. 1 shows a representative powder XRD pattern of compound A as Form L;\n FIG. 2 shows a representative DSC trace of compound A as Form L obtained by heating from 25\u00b0 C. to 325\u00b0 C. at 10\u00b0 C. per minute;\n FIG. 3 shows a representative powder XRD pattern of compound A as Form A;\n FIG. 4 shows a representative DSC trace of compound A as Form A obtained by heating from 25\u00b0 C. to 325\u00b0 C. at 10\u00b0 C. per minute.\n\nUse\nThe present invention provides compound A as Form L as an active compound, specifically, active in inhibiting the activity of PARP.\nThe term \u201cactive\u201d as used herein, pertains to the compound which is capable of inhibiting PARP activity.

Such a method may be practised in vitro or in vivo.\nFor example, a sample of cells may be grown in vitro and the active compound brought into contact with said cells, and the effect of the compound on those cells observed. As examples of \u201ceffect\u201d, the amount of DNA repair effected in a certain time may be determined. Where the active compound is found to exert an influence on the cells, this may be used as a prognostic or diagnostic marker of the efficacy of the compound in methods of treating a patient carrying cells of the same cellular type.\nThe term \u201ctreatment\u201d, as used herein in the context of treating a condition, pertains generally to treatment and therapy, whether of a human or an animal (e.g. in veterinary applications), in which some desired therapeutic effect is achieved, for example, the inhibition of the progress of the condition, and includes a reduction in the rate of progress, a halt in the rate of progress, amelioration of the condition, and cure of the condition. Treatment as a prophylactic measure (i.e. prophylaxis) is also included.\nThe term \u201cadjunct\u201d as used herein relates to the use of the active compound in conjunction with known therapeutic means. Such means include cytotoxic regimes of drugs and/or ionising radiation as used in the treatment of different cancer types. In particular, the active compounds are known to potentiate the actions of a number of cancer chemotherapy treatments, which include the topoisomerase class of poisons (e.g. topotecan, irinotecan, rubitecan), most of the known alkylating agents (e.g. DTIC, temozolamide) and platinum based drugs (e.g. carboplatin, cisplatin) used in treating cancer.\nThe active compound may also be used as cell culture additives to inhibit PARP, for example, in order to sensitize cells to known chemotherapeutic agents or ionising radiation treatments in vitro.\nThe active compound may also be used as part of an in vitro assay, for example, in order to determine whether a candidate host is likely to benefit from treatment with the compound in question.\nAdministration\nThe active compound or pharmaceutical composition comprising the active compound may be administered to a subject by any convenient route of administration, whether systemically/peripherally or at the site of desired action, including but not limited to, oral (e.g. by ingestion); topical (including e.g. transdermal, intranasal, ocular, buccal, and sublingual); pulmonary (e.g. by inhalation or insufflation therapy using, e.g. an aerosol, e.g. through mouth or nose); rectal; vaginal; parenteral, for example, by injection, including subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intracardiac, intrathecal, intraspinal, intracapsular, subcapsular, intraorbital, intraperitoneal, intratracheal, subcuticular, intraarticular, subarachnoid, and intrasternal; by implant of a depot, for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly.\nThe subject may be a eukaryote, an animal, a vertebrate animal, a mammal, a rodent (e.g. a guinea pig, a hamster, a rat, a mouse), murine (e.g. a mouse), canine (e.g. a dog), feline (e.g. a cat), equine (e.g. a horse), a primate, simian (e.g. a monkey or ape), a monkey (e.g. marmoset, baboon), an ape (e.g. gorilla, chimpanzee, orangutang, gibbon), or a human.\nFormulations\nWhile it is possible for the active compound to be administered alone, it is preferable to present it as a pharmaceutical composition (e.g., formulation) comprising the active compound, as defined above, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, excipients, diluents, fillers, buffers, stabilisers, preservatives, lubricants, or other materials well known to those skilled in the art and optionally other therapeutic or prophylactic agents.\nThus, the present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions, as defined above, and methods of making a pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing the active compound, as defined above, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, buffers, adjuvants, stabilisers, or other materials, as described herein, such that active compound remains as crystalline Form L.\nThe term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d as used herein pertains to compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgement, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of a subject (e.g. human) without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Each carrier, excipient, etc. must also be \u201cacceptable\u201d in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation.\nSuitable carriers, diluents, excipients, etc. can be found in standard pharmaceutical texts. See, for example, \u201cHandbook of Pharmaceutical Additives\u201d, 2nd Edition (eds. M. Ash and I. Ash), 2001 (Synapse Information Resources, Inc., Endicott, N.Y., USA), \u201cRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences\u201d, 20th edition, pub. Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, 2000; and \u201cHandbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients\u201d, 2nd edition, 1994.\nThe formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active compound with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active compound with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then if necessary shaping the product.\nFormulations may be in the form of suspensions, tablets, granules, powders, capsules, cachets, pills or pastes.\nFormulations suitable for oral administration (e.g., by ingestion) may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of the active compound; as a powder or granules; as a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; or as a paste.\nA tablet may be made by conventional means, e.g. compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active compound in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with one or more binders (e.g. povidone, gelatin, acacia, sorbitol, tragacanth, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose); fillers or diluents (e.g. lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, calcium hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (e.g. magnesium stearate, talc, silica); disintegrants (e.g. sodium starch glycolate, cross-linked povidone, cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose); surface-active or dispersing or wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulfate); and preservatives (e.g., methyl p-hydroxybenzoate, propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, sorbic acid). Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active compound therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile. Tablets may optionally be provided with an enteric coating, to provide release in parts of the gut other than the stomach.\nA capsule may include the active compound in suspension.\nFormulations suitable for topical administration (e.g. transdermal, intranasal, ocular, buccal, and sublingual) may be formulated as a paste.\nFormulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye drops wherein the active compound is suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active compound.\nFormulations suitable for nasal administration, wherein the carrier is a solid, include a coarse powder having a particle size, for example, in the range of about 20 to about 500 microns which is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e. by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to the nose.\nFormulations suitable for administration by inhalation include those presented as an aerosol spray from a pressurised pack, with the use of a suitable propellant, such as dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichoro-tetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide, or other suitable gases.\nDosage\nIt will be appreciated that appropriate dosages of the active compound, and compositions comprising the active compound, can vary from patient to patient. Determining the optimal dosage will generally involve the balancing of the level of therapeutic benefit against any risk or deleterious side effects of the treatments of the present invention. The selected dosage level will depend on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the activity of the particular compound, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the compound, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds, and/or materials used in combination, and the age, sex, weight, condition, general health, and prior medical history of the patient. The amount of compound and route of administration will ultimately be at the discretion of the physician, although generally the dosage will be to achieve local concentrations at the site of action which achieve the desired effect without causing substantial harmful or deleterious side-effects.\nAdministration in vivo can be effected in one dose, continuously or intermittently (e.g., in divided doses at appropriate intervals) throughout the course of treatment. Methods of determining the most effective means and dosage of administration are well known to those of skill in the art and will vary with the formulation used for therapy, the purpose of the therapy, the target cell being treated, and the subject being treated. Single or multiple administrations can be carried out with the dose level and pattern being selected by the treating physician.\nIn general, a suitable dose of the active compound is in the range of about 10 mg to about 600 mg per m2 body area weight of the subject per day.\nEXAMPLES\nGeneral Methods\nPowder XRD\nPowder X-ray diffraction was recorded with a Bruker D5000 diffractometer (wavelength of X-rays 1.5418 \u212b Cu source, Voltage 40 kV, filament emission 40 mA).

Typically less than 5 mg of material, contained in a 40 \u03bcl aluminium pan fitted with a pierced lid, was heated over the temperature range 25\u00b0 C. to 325\u00b0 C. at a constant heating rate of 10\u00b0 C. per minute. A nitrogen purge gas was used with flow rate 100 ml per minute.\nObtaining Compound A as Form A\n              \nNMR\n\n 1H NMR spectra were recorded using Bruker DPX 400 spectrometer at 400 MHz. Chemical shifts were reported in parts per million (ppm) on the \u03b4 scale relative to tetramethylsilane internal standard. Unless stated otherwise all samples were dissolved in DMSO-d6.\nMass Spectra\nMass spectra were recorded on an Agilent XCT ion trap mass spectrometer using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) for structural confirmation.

Diisopropylethylamine (19.6 ml, 112.3 mmol) was added followed by 1-cyclopropylcarbonylpiperazine (I)(9.45 g, 61.28 mmol) and acetonitrile (1 ml). The reaction mixture was cooled to 18\u00b0 C. 0-Benzotriazol-1-yl-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (25.18 g, 66.39 mmol) was added over 30 minutes and the reaction mixture was stirred for 2 hours at room temperature. The reaction mixture was cooled to 3\u00b0 C. and maintained at this temperature for 1 hour, before being filtered. The filter cake was washed with cold (3\u00b0 C.) acetonitrile (20 ml) before being dried in vacuo at up to 40\u00b0 C. to give the title compound as a pale yellow solid (20.21 g).\nMass Spectrum: MH+ 435\n1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) \u03b4: 0.70 (m, 4H), 1.88 (br s, 1H), 3.20 (br s, 2H), 3.56 (m, 6H), 4.31 (s, 2H), 7.17 (t, 1H), 7.34 (dd, 1H), 7.41 (m, 1H), 7.77 (dt, 1H), 7.83 (dt, 1H), 7.92 (d, 1H), 8.25 (dd, 1H), 12.53 (s, 1H).\n(b) Recrystallisation of Compound a from Ethanol\n4-(3-{[4-(cyclopropylcarbonyl)piperazin-1-yl]carbonyl}-4-fluorobenzyl)phthalazin-1(2H)-one (compound A) (20.00 g, 44.66 mmol) was suspended in a mixture of water (50 ml) and ethanol (150 ml). The suspension was heated to reflux with stirring. The solution produced was then cooled to 70\u00b0 C. and filtered. The filter pad was washed with a mixture of water (8 ml) and ethanol (22 ml).\nThe filtrate was cooled to 45\u00b0 C. with stirring. 4-(3-{[4-(cyclopropylcarbonyl)piperazin-1-yl]carbonyl}-4-fluorobenzyl)phthalazin-1(2H)-one (Compound A) in Form A (0.08 g) was added in order to seed the mixture. The resulting suspension was cooled to 20\u00b0 C. over 2.5 hours and was stirred at this temperature for a further 16 hours in order to establish crystallisation. Water (200 ml) was added over 5 hours maintaining the temperature at 20\u00b0 C. At the end of the addition the suspension was held at 20\u00b0 C. for 2 hours.\nThe suspension was filtered and the filter cake washed with a mixture of ethanol (24 ml) and water (56 ml).

To this solid was added 0.25 mL of a solution made from 8.5 mL methanol and 1.5 mL water (i.e. 15% water v/v). The resulting slurry was heated to 70\u00b0 C., filtered and allowed to cool slowly to ambient temperature in a capped vial. The resulting crystallisation yielded a solid which was dried by a vacuum oven.

All compounds were diluted in DMSO and gave final assay concentrations of between 10 and 0.01 \u03bcM, with the DMSO being at a final concentration of 1% per well. The total assay volume per well was 40 \u03bcl.\nAfter 10 minutes incubation at 30\u00b0 C. the reactions were initiated by the addition of a 10 \u03bcl reaction mixture, containing NAD (5 \u03bcM), 3H-NAD and 30mer double stranded DNA-oligos. Designated positive and negative reaction wells were done in combination with compound wells (unknowns) in order to calculate % enzyme activities. The plates were then shaken for 2 minutes and incubated at 30\u00b0 C. for 45 minutes.\nFollowing the incubation, the reactions were quenched by the addition of 50 \u03bcl 30% acetic acid to each well. The plates were then shaken for 1 hour at room temperature.\nThe plates were transferred to a TopCount NXT (TRADE MARK) (Packard, UK) for scintillation counting. Values recorded are counts per minute (cpm) following a 30 second counting of each well.\nThe % enzyme activity for the compound is then calculated using the following equation:\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\u2062\n\n \n\n\u2062\nInhibition\n\n=\n\n100\n-\n\n(\n\n100\n\u00d7\n\n\n(\n\n\nc\n\u2062\n\n \n\n\u2062\np\n\u2062\n\n \n\n\u2062\nm\n\u2062\n\n \n\n\u2062\nof\n\u2062\n\n \n\n\u2062\nunknowns\n\n-\n\nmean\n\u2062\n\n \n\n\u2062\nnegative\n\u2062\n\n \n\n\u2062\nc\n\u2062\n\n \n\n\u2062\np\n\u2062\n\n \n\n\u2062\nm\n\n\n)\n\n\n(\n\n\nmean\n\u2062\n\n \n\n\u2062\npositive\n\u2062\n\n \n\n\u2062\nc\n\u2062\n\n \n\n\u2062\np\n\u2062\n\n \n\n\u2062\nm\n\n-\n\nmean\n\u2062\n\n \n\n\u2062\nneagative\n\u2062\n\n \n\n\u2062\nc\n\u2062\n\n \n\n\u2062\np\n\u2062\n\n \n\n\u2062\nm\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIC50 values (the concentration at which 50% of the enzyme activity is inhibited) were calculated, which are determined over a range of different concentrations, normally from 10 \u03bcM down to 0.001 \u03bcM. Such IC50 values are used as comparative values to identify increased compound potencies.\nCompound A has an IC50 of about 5 nM.\nPotentiation Factor\nThe Potentiation Factor (PF50) for the active compound is calculated as a ratio of the IC50 of control cell growth divided by the IC50 of cell growth+PARP inhibitor. Growth inhibition curves for both control and compound treated cells are in the presence of the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). The test compound was used at a fixed concentration of 0.2 micromolar. The concentrations of MMS were over a range from 0 to 10 \u03bcg/ml.\nCell growth was assessed using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay (Skehan, P., et al., (1990) New colorimetric cytotoxicity assay for anticancer-drug screening. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 82, 1107-1112.). 2,000 HeLa cells were seeded into each well of a flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plate in a volume of 100 \u03bcl and incubated for 6 hours at 37\u00b0 C. Cells were either replaced with media alone or with media containing PARP inhibitor at a final concentration of 0.5, 1 or 5 \u03bcM. Cells were allowed to grow for a further 1 hour before the addition of MMS at a range of concentrations (typically 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10 \u03bcg/ml) to either untreated cells or PARP inhibitor treated cells. Cells treated with PARP inhibitor alone were used to assess the growth inhibition by the PARP inhibitor.\nCells were left for a further 16 hours before replacing the media and allowing the cells to grow for a further 72 hours at 37\u00b0 C. The media was then removed and the cells fixed with 100 \u03bcl of ice cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The plates were incubated at 4\u00b0 C. for 20 minutes and then washed four times with water. Each well of cells was then stained with 100 \u03bcl of 0.4% (w/v) SRB in 1% acetic acid for 20 minutes before washing four times with 1% acetic acid. Plates were then dried for 2 hours at room temperature. The dye from the stained cells was solubilized by the addition of 100 \u03bcl of 10 mM Tris Base into each well. Plates were gently shaken and left at room temperature for 30 minutes before measuring the optical density at 564 nM on a Microquant microtiter plate reader.\nCompound A has a PF50 at 200 nM of at least 20.",

        "description": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\nThis application is a Continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/873,671, filed Oct. 17, 2007, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/829,694, filed Oct. 17, 2006, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.\nThe present invention relates to a crystalline form and improved methods of synthesis of a particular phthalazinone derivative, intermediates in the synthesis and pharmaceutical compositions and uses of the crystalline form.\nThe mammalian enzyme PARP (a 113-kDa multidomain protein) has been implicated in the signalling of DNA damage through its ability to recognize and rapidly bind to DNA single or double strand breaks (D'Amours, et al., Biochem. J., 342, 249-268 (1999)).\nSeveral observations have led to the conclusion that PARP participates in a variety of DNA-related functions including gene amplification, cell division, differentiation, apoptosis, DNA base excision repair and also effects on telomere length and chromosome stability (d'Adda di Fagagna, et al., Nature Gen., 23(1), 76-80 (1999)).\nStudies on the mechanism by which PARP modulates DNA repair and other processes has identified its importance in the formation of poly (ADP-ribose) chains within the cellular nucleus (Althaus, F. R. and Richter, C., ADP-Ribosylation of Proteins: Enzymology and Biological Significance, Springer-Verlag, Berlin (1987)). The DNA-bound, activated PARP utilizes NAD to synthesize poly (ADP-ribose) on a variety of nuclear target proteins, including topoisomerase, histones and PARP itself (Rhun, et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 245, 1-10 (1998))\nPoly (ADP-ribosyl)ation has also been associated with malignant transformation. For example, PARP activity is higher in the isolated nuclei of SV40-transformed fibroblasts, while both leukemic cells and colon cancer cells show higher enzyme activity than the equivalent normal leukocytes and colon mucosa (Miwa, et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 181, 313-321 (1977); Burzio, et al., Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med., 149, 933-938 (1975); and Hirai, et al., Cancer Res., 43, 3441-3446 (1983)).\nA number of low-molecular-weight inhibitors of PARP have been used to elucidate the functional role of poly (ADP-ribosyl)ation in DNA repair. In cells treated with alkylating agents, the inhibition of PARP leads to a marked increase in DNA-strand breakage and cell killing (Durkacz, et al., Nature, 283, 593-596 (1980); Berger, N. A., Radiation Research, 101, 4-14 (1985)).\nSubsequently, such inhibitors have been shown to enhance the effects of radiation response by suppressing the repair of potentially lethal damage (Ben-Hur, et al., British Journal of Cancer, 49 (Suppl. VI), 34-42 (1984); Schlicker, et al., Int. J. Radiat. Bioi., 75, 91-100 (1999)). PARP inhibitors have been reported to be effective in radio sensitising hypoxic tumour cells (U.S. Pat. No. 5,032,617; U.S. Pat. No. 5,215,738 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,041,653).\nFurthermore, PARP knockout (PARP\u2212/\u2212) animals exhibit genomic instability in response to alkylating agents and \u03b3-irradiation (Wang, et al., Genes Dev., 9, 509-520 (1995); Menissier de Murcia, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 94, 7303-7307 (1997)).\nA role for PARP has also been demonstrated in certain vascular diseases, septic shock, ischaemic injury and neurotoxicity (Cantoni, et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1014, 1-7 (1989); Szabo, et al., J. Clin. Invest., 100, 723-735 (1997)). Oxygen radical DNA damage that leads to strand breaks in DNA, which are subsequently recognised by PARP, is a major contributing factor to such disease states as shown by PARP inhibitor studies (Cosi, et al., J. Neurosci. Res., 39, 38-46 (1994); Said, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 93, 4688-4692 (1996)). More recently, PARP has been demonstrated to play a role in the pathogenesis of haemorrhagic shock (Liaudet, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 97(3), 10203-10208 (2000)).\nIt has also been demonstrated that efficient retroviral infection of mammalian cells is blocked by the inhibition of PARP activity. Such inhibition of recombinant retroviral vector infections was shown to occur in various different cell types (Gaken, et al., J. Virology, 70(6), 3992-4000 (1996)). Inhibitors of PARP have thus been developed for the use in anti-viral therapies and in cancer treatment (WO 91/18591).\nMoreover, PARP inhibition has been speculated to delay the onset of aging characteristics in human fibroblasts (Rattan and Clark, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm., 201(2), 665-672 (1994)). This may be related to the role that PARP plays in controlling telomere function (d'Adda di Fagagna, et al., Nature Gen., 23(1), 76-80 (1999)).\nWO 2004/080976 discloses a number of phthalazinone derivatives, their activity in inhibiting PARP, and their consequential use in treating cancer, whether as an adjunct to radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or as a stand alone agent.\nWO 2005/053662 describes the use of PARP inhibitors, in particular phthalazinone derivatives, as base excision repair (BER) inhibitors. The use of these inhibitors in the manufacture of medicaments for the treatment of cancers which are deficient in Homologous Recombination (HR) dependent DNA DSB repair activity, in particular for cancers which have a BRCA1 and/or a BRCA2 deficient phenotype, is described.\n4-[3-(4-Cyclopropanecarbonyl-piperazine-1-carbonyl)-4-fluoro-benzyl]-2H-phthalazin-1-one (compound A) disclosed in WO 2004/080976:\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nis of particular interest.\nIn WO 2004/080976, compound A was synthesised as one of a number of library compounds from 4-[4-fluoro-3-(piperazine-1-carbonyl)-benzyl]-2H-phthalazin-1-one (compound B):\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nby the addition of cyclopropanecarbonyl chloride:\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nto a solution of (B) in dichloromethane, followed by H\u00fcnig's base (N,N-diisopropylethyl amine). This reaction is carried out with stirring at room temperature for 16 hours, and the resulting compound being purified by preparative HPLC.\nThe piperazine derivative (B) was prepared by deprotecting 4-[2-fluoro-5-(4-oxo-3,4-dihydro-phthalazin-1-ylmethyl)-benzoyl]-piperazine-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester (compound C):\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nby the use of 6M HCl and ethanol for 1 hour, followed by basification with ammonia to pH 9, and extraction into dichloromethane.\nThe Boc-protected piperazine derivative (C) was prepared from 2-fluoro-5-(4-oxo-3,4-dihydro-phthalazin-1-ylmethyl)-benzoic acid (compound D):\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nby the addition of piperazine-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester:\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\n2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) and N,N,-diisopropylethylamine in dimethylacetamide, followed by stirring for 18 hours.\nParticular forms of compound A may have advantageous properties, for example with regard to their solubility and/or their stability and/or their bioavailability and/or their impurity profile and/or their filtration characteristics and/or their drying characteristics and/or their lack of hygroscopicity, and/or they may be easier to handle and/or micronise and/or form into tablets. It is also desired to have an improved method of synthesis that is suitable for synthesis of compound A on a multi-gram scale.\nAccordingly, a first aspect of the present invention provides 4-[3-(4-cyclopropanecarbonyl-piperazine-1-carbonyl)-4-fluoro-benzyl]-2H-phthalazin-1-one (compound A) substantially in crystalline form, and in particular in Form A.\n\u201cSubstantially in crystalline form\u201d as used above, means that at least 50% by weight of compound A is in crystalline form, preferably at least 70% by weight, 80% or 90% by weight. In some embodiments, at least 95% by weight, 99% by weight or even 99.5% or more by weight may be in crystalline form.\nCompound A as crystalline Form A has an X-ray diffraction pattern (\u03bb=1.5418 \u212b) containing specific peaks at:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \nPeak\n2\u03b8\u00b0 (\u00b10.1\u00b0)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n1\n12.0\n\n\n \n2\n17.8\n\n\n \n3\n21.1\n\n\n \n4\n22.3\n\n\n \n5\n29.2\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound A as crystalline form A may also have the following additional peaks an X-ray diffraction pattern (\u03bb=1.5418 \u212b):\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \nPeak\n2\u03b8\u00b0 (\u00b10.1\u00b0)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n6\n10.5\n\n\n \n7\n14.0\n\n\n \n8\n21.7\n\n\n \n9\n24.3\n\n\n \n10\n26.1\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound A as crystalline Form A may also be characterised by any combination of three or more peaks selected from the list of 10 peaks above.\nA representative powder XRD pattern of compound A as Form A is shown in FIG. 3.\nWithout wishing to be bound by theory, compound A is able to readily form a structure in which solvent molecules can occupy positions within the crystal lattice. Such solvates, not necessarily stoichiometric in nature, can consist of one pure solvate (e.g. Compound A methanolate, and Compound A Tetrahydrofuranate) or potentially can consist of more than one solvent component (e.g. methanol and di-ethyl ether). The solvent molecules typically lie within pockets created by the Compound A molecules. In certain circumstances, the volume of these pockets are sufficiently flexible to incorporate a range of solvents, resulting in little change in the overall structure of the material, and hence only small shifts in the XRPD reflections.\nSolvates, including those which share the same overall structure, arise from solution maturation and crystallisation experiments from dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, 2-butanone, t-butyl methyl ether, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, water, cyclohexane, cyclopropyl methyl ketone, 1,2 dichloroethane, ethyl trifluoroacetate, fluorobenzenehexafluoro-iso-propanol, methyl nonafluorobutyl ether, 2-methyl-1-propanol, nitromethane, propionitrile, trichloroethylene, \u03b1\u03b1\u03b1-trifluorotoluene, heptane, dioxane, acetonitrile, either as pure solvents or when combined with another solvent. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the most common solvate structure is shown in FIG. 4, and typically contains most intense peaks at positions listed below:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n2\u03b8\u00b0 (\u00b10.1\u00b0)\n\n\n \nPeak\n(\u03bb = 1.5418 \u212b)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n1\n7.0-7.5\n\n\n \n2\n10.1-10.6\n\n\n \n3\n15.1-15.6\n\n\n \n4\n18.5-19.0\n\n\n \n5\n21.0-21.5\n\n\n \n6\n24.8-25.3\n\n\n \n7\n27.0-27.5\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will be understood that the relative intensities of peaks shown in the figures may vary according to the orientation of the sample under test and on the type and setting of the instrument used so that the intensities in the XRD traces included herein are illustrative and not intended to be used for absolute comparison.\nForm A of compound A is substantially free from solvent. The term \u201csubstantially free from solvent\u201d as used herein refers to the form having only insignificant amounts of any solvent, e.g. a form with a total of 0.5% by weight or less of any solvent. The total amount of any solvent, including water, may be 0.25%, 0.1%, 0.05% or 0.025% by weight or less.\nForm A of compound A may also be characterised using DSC. Form A of compound A when heated from 25\u00b0 C. to 325\u00b0 C. at 10\u00b0 C. per minute will begin melting at 210.1\u00b0 C.\u00b11\u00b0 C. A representative DSC trace for compound A as Form A is shown in FIG. 5.\nThe second aspect of the present invention provides a method of obtaining 4-[3-(4-cyclopropanecarbonyl-piperazine-1-carbonyl)-4-fluoro-benzyl]-2H-phthalazin-1-one (compound A) as crystalline Form A which comprises crystallising compound A in a solvent and then displacing the solvent from the crystalline form with a displacing agent. The displacing agent may be water or a mixture of a C1-2 alcohol and water.\nIn a first embodiment, this method comprises the steps of:\n(i) crystallising 4-[3-(4-cyclopropanecarbonyl-piperazine-1-carbonyl)-4-fluoro-benzyl]-2H-phthalazin-1-one (compound A) from a solvent;\n(ii) if the original solvent is not ethanol, treating the crystalline compound A with ethanol;\n(iii) treating the crystalline compound A with water to remove trapped ethanol;\n(iv) drying the resulting product.\nThe solvent used in the original crystallisation may be, for example, dichloromethane or acetonitrile.\nThe methods for obtaining Form A may generally involve solvent replacement. It has been found that compound A crystallises in such a way that channels in the crystal lattice are formed which can trap solvents, thus making them difficult to remove.\nThe method of the first embodiment can be used in particular if the solvent used in the crystallisation of compound A is dichloromethane. The step of exchanging the dichloromethane as a solvent with ethanol as a solvent can be carried out by distilling the solution of compound A at atmospheric pressure in the presence of ethanol. The exchange is complete when the head temperature approaches the boiling point of ethanol, e.g. at least 73\u00b0 C. In particular, the exchange may be carried out by distilling out the majority of the DCM, then adding a volume of ethanol. The distillation is then continued, with replacing batches of distillate with equal volumes of ethanol.\nCrystallising compound A from the ethanol solvent may be carried out by cooling the solution to below 15\u00b0 C., preferably less than 10\u00b0 C., and more preferably to about 8\u00b0 C. The crystals of compound A may then be removed from solution by filtration.\nThe crystalline compound A may be treated with water to remove trapped ethanol by suspended the crystalline material in water and heating at reflux for a sufficient time, for example at least three hours, and preferably for about four hours. The crystalline compound A may be removed from suspension in water by filtration.\nDrying the resulting product of the above step is readily achieved. For example, by heating the product in an oven at a temperature of at least 60\u00b0 C., preferably at about 70\u00b0 C.\nIn another such embodiment, the method comprises the steps of:\n(i) obtaining compound A as crystalline form containing solvent;\n(ii) if the original solvent used in the synthesis of compound A in the crystalline form is not a mixture of water and a C1-2 alcohol (i.e. methanol, ethanol), treating compound A in the crystalline form with a mixture of water and a C1-2 alcohol;\n(ii) drying the resulting product.\nThe resulting product can be further treated with a mixture of water and a C1-2 alcohol, and dried in order to further isolate compound A in a crystalline Form A.\nThe mixture of water and C1-2 alcohol is preferably in the range of 2:1 to 1:2 by volume, and more preferably 1.5:1 to 1:1.5 by volume. A particularly preferred mixture is 1 part water to 1.2 parts C1-2 alcohol. Another particularly preferred mixture is 2 parts water to 1 part C1-2 alcohol. The C1-2 alcohol is preferably ethanol.\nCompound A as crystalline Form may be obtained by crystallisation of the compound A from a solvent, as described above.\nThe solvent treatment in step (ii) may be carried out by suspending compound A in the mixture of water and C1-2 alcohol and heating to reflux with stirring. This may be followed by cooling to between 55 and 65\u00b0 C. and filtering, e.g. through a celite pad. The filter pad may be washed with a mixture of water and C1-2 alcohol before being distilled at ambient pressure (usually 1 atm), or above. The distillation may be stopped to yield a suspension that is left at room temperature before subsequent filtration. The resulting filter cake may be washed with water.\nDrying the resulting product of the above step is readily achieved. For example, by heating the product in an oven at a temperature of at least 50\u00b0 C., preferably at about 60\u00b0 C.\nThe further treatment may proceed in a similar manner to that described above.\nIn a third embodiment, the method comprises:\n(i) suspending compound A in a mixture of water and a C1-2 alcohol as the solvent;\n(ii) heating the suspension to reflux;\n(iii) cooling the solution and seeding with compound A as Form A;\n(iv) drying the resulting product.\nThe resulting product can be further treated with a mixture of water and a C1-2 alcohol, and dried in order to further isolate compound A in a crystalline Form A.\nThe mixture of water and C1-2 alcohol is preferably in the range of 2:1 to 1:5 by volume, and more preferably 1:2 to 1:4 by volume. A particularly preferred mixture is 1 part water to 3 parts C1-2 alcohol. The C1-2 alcohol is preferably ethanol.\nStep (iii) may comprise cooling the solution to between 65 and 75\u00b0 C. (e.g. 70\u00b0 C.) and filtering, e.g. through a celite pad. The filter pad may be washed with a mixture of water and C1-2 alcohol before being distilled (e.g. at ambient pressure, or above). The seeding may occur after the resulting filtrate has been cooled to between 40 and 50\u00b0 C. (e.g. 45\u00b0 C.). The resulting suspension may be cooled to ambient temperature (e.g. 20\u00b0 C.) in between 2 and 3 hours (e.g. 2.5 hours) and maintained at said temperature for long enough to establish crystallisation. This may be between 12 and 24 hours, and may be for about 16 hours. At the end of this period, further water may be added. The amount may be about equal to the volume of total solvent (water and C1-2 alcohol) present and may be added slowly, for example over a period of 4 to 6 (e.g. 5) hours. The suspension may be held at ambient temperature after the water addition, for example for 2 hours.\nThe suspension may then be filtered, and the resulting filter cake may be washed with a mixture of C1-2 alcohol and water (in a ratio of between 1:3 and 1:2, e.g. 1:2.3).\nDrying the resulting product of the above step is readily achieved. For example, by heating the product in an oven under vacuum at a temperature of between 40 and 60\u00b0 C.\nA third aspect of the present invention provides a method of synthesising compound A from compound B comprising the step of:\n    (i) adding a pre-mixed solution of triethylamine and cyclopropane carbonyl chloride, in an appropriate organic solvent (for example, DCM (dichloromethane)) in a controlled manner, to compound B in the same organic solvent with the temperature of the solution being controlled to be below 20\u00b0 C.   \nIn some embodiments, the method further comprises the step of:\n    (ii) agitating (e.g. stirring) the resulting solution from (i) until the reaction is complete, whilst maintaining the temperature of the solution below 20\u00b0 C.   \nThe addition in step (i) may take place in a dropwise manner\nThis method is more controlled than that described in WO 2004/080976, resulting in a more regioselective addition of the acid chloride. The less controlled method of the prior art can lead to addition of the acid chloride at the phthalazinone nitrogen and or oxygen, as well as at the desired piperidine nitrogen.\nIt is preferred that the above method is carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere.\nIt is further preferred that the temperature of the solution in stage (ii) is maintained between 10 and 15\u00b0 C.\nThe product of the above reaction is preferably worked up by at least one water washing step. More preferably the work up contains an initial and final water washing steps, and intermediate washing steps using a dilute acid, e.g. 5% citric acid solution, followed by a dilute base, e.g. 5% sodium carbonate solution.\nA fourth aspect of the present invention provides a method of synthesising compound A from compound D comprising reacting compound D with 1-(cyclopropylcarbonyl)piperazine, or a mineral acid salt thereof, in the presence of an amide coupling agent and a base, for example, an amine (e.g. a tertiary amine, such as diisopropylethylamine).\nThe mineral acid salt may be, for example, the hydrochloride salt.\nThe addition of 1-(cyclopropylcarbonyl)piperazine, or a mineral acid salt thereof, to compound D may be carried out in any suitable solvent, for example, acetonitrile. The amide coupling agent is preferably 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU). It is preferably added to the solution of 1-(cyclopropylcarbonyl)piperazine, or its mineral acid salt, diisopropylethylamine and compound D over a period of time, for example 30 minutes. The temperature of the resulting solution may be maintained at 25\u00b0 C. or below (or 20\u00b0 C. or below, e.g. at 18\u00b0 C.). After its addition, the resulting solution may be left to stand for a period of time. A preferred temperature regime is holding the solution at room temperature for 2 hours.\nThe resulting compound A may be removed from the solution by cooling to below 10\u00b0 C. (or below 5\u00b0 C., for example, 3\u00b0 C.) for a period of time (e.g. 1 hour), followed by filtration. The resulting compound A may be washed, for example, with cold acetonitrile.\nIn WO 2004/080976, the following route to compound D is disclosed:\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nDimethyl phosphite was added drop-wise to a solution of sodium methoxide in methanol at 0\u00b0 C. 2-Carboxybenzaldehyde (H) was then added portion-wise to the reaction mixture as a slurry in methanol, with the temperature kept below 5\u00b0 C. The resulting pale yellow solution was warmed to 20\u00b0 C. over 1 hour. Methanesulphonic acid was added to the reaction drop-wise and the resulting white suspension was evaporated in vacuo. The white residue was quenched with water and extracted into chloroform. The combined organic extracts were washed with water, dried over MgSO4, and evaporated in vacuo to yield (3-oxo-1,3-dihydro-isobenzofuran-1-yl) phosphonic acid dimethyl ester (G) as a white solid (yield: 95%). This was then used without further purification in the next stage.\nTo a mixture of (3-oxo-1,3-dihydro-isobenzofuran-1-yl)phosphonic acid dimethyl ester (G) in tetrahydrofuran and 2-fluoro-5-formylbenzonitrile (F) in tetrahydrofuran was added triethylamine drop-wise over 25 min, with the temperature kept below 15\u00b0 C. The reaction mixture was warmed slowly to 20\u00b0 C. over 1 hour and concentrated in vacuo. The white residue was slurried in water or 30 minutes, filtered, washed with water, hexane and ether, and dried to yield 2-fluoro-5-(3-oxo-3H-isobenzofuran-1-ylidenemethyl)benzonitrile (E) as a 50:50 mixture of E and Z isomers (yield: 96%).\nTo a suspension of 2-fluoro-5-(3-oxo-3H-isobenzofuran-1-ylidenemethyl)benzonitrile (E) in water was added aqueous sodium hydroxide solution and the reaction mixture was heated under nitrogen to 90\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes. The reaction mixture was partially cooled to 70\u00b0 C., and hydrazine hydrate was added and stirred for 18 hours at 70\u00b0 C. The reaction was cooled to room temperature and acidified with 2M HCl to pH 4. The mixture was stirred for 10 minutes and filtered. The resulting solid was washed with water, hexane, ether, ethyl acetate and dried to yield compound D as a pale pink powder (yield: 77%).\nIt is also desired to have an improved method of synthesis of compound D.\nAccordingly a fifth aspect of the present invention provides a method synthesising compound D, comprising the step of:\n(a) synthesising diethyl (3-oxo-1,3-dihydro-2-benzofuran-1-yl)phosphonate (G\u2032) from 2-carboxybenzaldehyde (H);\n(b) synthesising 2-fluoro-5-[(E/Z)-(3-oxo-2-benzofuran-1(3H)-ylidene)methyl]benzonitrile (E) from diethyl (3-oxo-1,3-dihydro-2-benzofuran-1-yl)phosphonate.\nIt is preferred that compound G\u2032 is not isolated in the synthesis. This method avoids the use of the sodium salt of dimethylphosphite which is unstable (Pelchowicz, et al., J. Chem. Soc, 4348-4350 (1961)) in alcoholic solution. It is preferred that the step (a) occurs in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran in which the sodium salt of diethyl phosphite is stable. This salt may be formed in situ by adding diethyl phosphite to a cooled solution of sodium t-amylate in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran. The reaction with the sodium salt of diethyl phosphite may be followed by reaction with methanesulphonic acid.\nStep (b) may be carried out in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, with the addition of triethylamine.\nThe method of synthesising compound D may further comprise the step of:\n(c) synthesising 2-fluoro-5-[(4-oxo-3,4-dihydrophthalazin-1-yl)methyl]benzonitrile (ED):\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nfrom compound E by reaction with hydrazine hydrate; and\n(d) synthesising compound D from compound ED by reaction with sodium hydroxide.\nStep (c) may be achieved by using between 1.1 and 1.3 equivalents of hydrazine hydrate in tetrahydrofuran followed by neutralisation of the excess hydrazine hydrate using acetic acid.\nA sixth aspect of the present invention provides the compound ED:\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nand its use in the synthesis of compound D.\nA further aspect of the invention provides a mineral acid salt of 1-(cyclopropylcarbonyl) piperazine, and a method of synthesis thereof by reacting piperazine with acetic acid, followed by addition of cyclopropanecarbonyl chloride.\nA seventh aspect of the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the first aspect and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.\nAn eighth aspect of the present invention provides a compound of the first aspect for use in a method of treatment of the human or animal body.\nA ninth aspect of the present invention provides the use of a compound as defined in the first aspect of the invention in the preparation of a medicament for inhibiting the activity of PARP.\nFurther aspects of the invention provide the use of a compound as defined in the first aspect of the invention in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of: vascular disease; septic shock; ischaemic injury; neurotoxicity; haemorraghic shock; viral infection; or diseases ameliorated by the inhibition of the activity of PARP.\nAnother further aspect of the invention provides for the use of a compound as defined in the first aspect of the invention in the preparation of a medicament for use as an adjunct in cancer therapy or for potentiating tumour cells for treatment with ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic agents.\nOther further aspects of the invention provide for the treatment of disease ameliorated by the inhibition of PARP, comprising administering to a subject in need of treatment a therapeutically-effective amount of a compound as defined in the first aspect, preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition and the treatment of cancer, comprising administering to a subject in need of treatment a therapeutically-effective amount of a compound as defined in the first aspect in combination, preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, simultaneously or sequentially with ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic agents.\nIn further aspects of the present invention, the compounds may be used in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of cancer which is deficient in Homologous Recombination (HR) dependent DNA DSB repair activity, or in the treatment of a patient of a cancer which is deficient in HR dependent DNA DSB repair activity, comprising administering to said patient a therapeutically-effective amount of the compound.\nThe HR dependent DNA DSB repair pathway repairs double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA via homologous mechanisms to reform a continuous DNA helix (K. K. Khanna and S. P. Jackson, Nat. Genet. 27(3): 247-254 (2001)). The components of the HR dependent DNA DSB repair pathway include, but are not limited to, ATM (NM\u2014000051), RAD51 (NM\u2014002875), RAD51L1 (NM\u2014002877), RAD51C (NM\u2014002876), RAD51L3 (NM\u2014002878), DMC1 (NM\u2014007068), XRCC2 (NM\u2014005431), XRCC3 (NM\u2014005432), RAD52 (NM\u2014002879), RAD54L (NM\u2014003579), RAD54B (NM\u2014012415), BRCA1 (NM\u2014007295), BRCA2 (NM\u2014000059), RAD50 (NM\u2014005732), MRE11A (NM\u2014005590) and NBS1 (NM\u2014002485). Other proteins involved in the HR dependent DNA DSB repair pathway include regulatory factors such as EMSY (Hughes-Davies, et al., Cell, 115, pp 523-535). HR components are also described in Wood, et al., Science, 291, 1284-1289 (2001).\nA cancer which is deficient in HR dependent DNA DSB repair may comprise or consist of one or more cancer cells which have a reduced or abrogated ability to repair DNA DSBs through that pathway, relative to normal cells i.e. the activity of the HR dependent DNA DSB repair pathway may be reduced or abolished in the one or more cancer cells.\nThe activity of one or more components of the HR dependent DNA DSB repair pathway may be abolished in the one or more cancer cells of an individual having a cancer which is deficient in HR dependent DNA DSB repair. Components of the HR dependent DNA DSB repair pathway are well characterised in the art (see for example, Wood, et al., Science, 291, 1284-1289 (2001)) and include the components listed above.\nIn some preferred embodiments, the cancer cells may have a BRCA1 and/or a BRCA2 deficient phenotype i.e. BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 activity is reduced or abolished in the cancer cells. Cancer cells with this phenotype may be deficient in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2, i.e. expression and/or activity of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 may be reduced or abolished in the cancer cells, for example by means of mutation or polymorphism in the encoding nucleic acid, or by means of amplification, mutation or polymorphism in a gene encoding a regulatory factor, for example the EMSY gene which encodes a BRCA2 regulatory factor (Hughes-Davies, et al., Cell, 115, 523-535).\nBRCA1 and BRCA2 are known tumour suppressors whose wild-type alleles are frequently lost in tumours of heterozygous carriers (Jasin M., Oncogene, 21(58), 8981-93 (2002); Tutt, et al., Trends Mol Med., 8(12), 571-6, (2002)). The association of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutations with breast cancer is well-characterised in the art (Radice, P. J., Exp Clin Cancer Res., 21(3 Suppl), 9-12 (2002)). Amplification of the EMSY gene, which encodes a BRCA2 binding factor, is also known to be associated with breast and ovarian cancer.\nCarriers of mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 are also at elevated risk of cancer of the ovary, prostate and pancreas.\nIn some preferred embodiments, the individual is heterozygous for one or more variations, such as mutations and polymorphisms, in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 or a regulator thereof. The detection of variation in BRCA1 and BRCA2 is well-known in the art and is described, for example in EP 699 754, EP 705 903, Neuhausen, S. L. and Ostrander, E. A., Genet. Test, 1, 75-83 (1992); Chappnis, P. O. and Foulkes, W.

Determination of amplification of the BRCA2 binding factor EMSY is described in Hughes-Davies, et al., Cell, 115, 523-535).\nMutations and polymorphisms associated with cancer may be detected at the nucleic acid level by detecting the presence of a variant nucleic acid sequenc or at the protein level by detecting the presence of a variant (i.e. a mutant or allelic variant) polypeptide.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES\n FIG. 1 shows the NMR of compound A after water treatment (example 1);\n FIG. 2 shows the powder XRD pattern of compound A as Form A after water treatment (example 1);\n FIG. 3 shows a representative powder XRD pattern of compound A as Form A;\n FIG. 4 shows a representative powder XRD pattern of compound A as solvated form;\n FIG. 5 shows a representative DSC trace of compound A as Form A obtained by heating from 25\u00b0 C. to 325\u00b0 C. at 10\u00b0 C. per minute.\n\nUSE\nThe present invention provides compound A as Form A as an active compound, specifically, active in inhibiting the activity of PARP.\nThe term \u201cactive\u201d as used herein, pertains to the compound which is capable of inhibiting PARP activity. One assay which may conveniently be used in order to assess the PARP inhibition offered by the compound is described in the examples below.\nThe present invention further provides a method of inhibiting the activity of PARP in a cell, comprising contacting said cell with an effective amount of the active compound, preferably in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable composition. Such a method may be practised in vitro or in vivo.\nFor example, a sample of cells may be grown in vitro and the active compound brought into contact with said cells, and the effect of the compound on those cells observed. As examples of \u201ceffect\u201d, the amount of DNA repair effected in a certain time may be determined. Where the active compound is found to exert an influence on the cells, this may be used as a prognostic or diagnostic marker of the efficacy of the compound in methods of treating a patient carrying cells of the same cellular type.\nThe term \u201ctreatment\u201d, as used herein in the context of treating a condition, pertains generally to treatment and therapy, whether of a human or an animal (e.g. in veterinary applications), in which some desired therapeutic effect is achieved, for example, the inhibition of the progress of the condition, and includes a reduction in the rate of progress, a halt in the rate of progress, amelioration of the condition, and cure of the condition. Treatment as a prophylactic measure (i.e. prophylaxis) is also included.\nThe term \u201cadjunct\u201d as used herein relates to the use of the active compound in conjunction with known therapeutic means. Such means include cytotoxic regimes of drugs and/or ionising radiation as used in the treatment of different cancer types. In particular, the active compounds are known to potentiate the actions of a number of cancer chemotherapy treatments, which include the topoisomerase class of poisons (e.g. topotecan, irinotecan, rubitecan), most of the known alkylating agents (e.g. DTIC, temozolamide) and platinum based drugs (e.g. carboplatin, cisplatin) used in treating cancer.\nThe active compound may also be used as cell culture additives to inhibit PARP, for example, in order to sensitize cells to known chemotherapeutic agents or ionising radiation treatments in vitro.\nThe active compound may also be used as part of an in vitro assay, for example, in order to determine whether a candidate host is likely to benefit from treatment with the compound in question.\nAdministration\nThe active compound or pharmaceutical composition comprising the active compound may be administered to a subject by any convenient route of administration, whether systemically/peripherally or at the site of desired action, including but not limited to, oral (e.g. by ingestion); topical (including e.g. transdermal, intranasal, ocular, buccal, and sublingual); pulmonary (e.g. by inhalation or insufflation therapy using, e.g. an aerosol, e.g. through mouth or nose); rectal; vaginal; parenteral, for example, by injection, including subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intracardiac, intrathecal, intraspinal, intracapsular, subcapsular, intraorbital, intraperitoneal, intratracheal, subcuticular, intraarticular, subarachnoid, and intrasternal; by implant of a depot, for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly.\nThe subject may be a eukaryote, an animal, a vertebrate animal, a mammal, a rodent (e.g. a guinea pig, a hamster, a rat, a mouse), murine (e.g. a mouse), canine (e.g. a dog), feline (e.g. a cat), equine (e.g. a horse), a primate, simian (e.g. a monkey or ape), a monkey (e.g. marmoset, baboon), an ape (e.g. gorilla, chimpanzee, orangutang, gibbon), or a human.\nFormulations\nWhile it is possible for the active compound to be administered alone, it is preferable to present it as a pharmaceutical composition (e.g., formulation) comprising the active compound, as defined above, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, excipients, diluents, fillers, buffers, stabilisers, preservatives, lubricants, or other materials well known to those skilled in the art and optionally other therapeutic or prophylactic agents.\nThus, the present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions, as defined above, and methods of making a pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing the active compound, as defined above, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, buffers, adjuvants, stabilisers, or other materials, as described herein, such that active compound remains as crystalline Form A.\nThe term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d as used herein pertains to compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgement, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of a subject (e.g. human) without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Each carrier, excipient, etc. must also be \u201cacceptable\u201d in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation.\nSuitable carriers, diluents, excipients, etc. can be found in standard pharmaceutical texts. See, for example, \u201cHandbook of Pharmaceutical Additives\u201d, 2nd Edition (eds. M. Ash and I. Ash), 2001 (Synapse Information Resources, Inc., Endicott, N.Y., USA), \u201cRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences\u201d, 20th edition, pub. Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, 2000; and \u201cHandbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients\u201d, 2nd edition, 1994.\nThe formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active compound with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active compound with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then if necessary shaping the product.\nFormulations may be in the form of suspensions, tablets, granules, powders, capsules, cachets, pills or pastes.\nFormulations suitable for oral administration (e.g., by ingestion) may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of the active compound; as a powder or granules; as a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; or as a paste.\nA tablet may be made by conventional means, e.g. compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active compound in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with one or more binders (e.g. povidone, gelatin, acacia, sorbitol, tragacanth, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose); fillers or diluents (e.g. lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, calcium hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (e.g. magnesium stearate, talc, silica); disintegrants (e.g. sodium starch glycolate, cross-linked povidone, cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose); surface-active or dispersing or wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulfate); and preservatives (e.g., methyl p-hydroxybenzoate, propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, sorbic acid). Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active compound therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile. Tablets may optionally be provided with an enteric coating, to provide release in parts of the gut other than the stomach.\nA capsule may include the active compound in suspension.\nFormulations suitable for topical administration (e.g. transdermal, intranasal, ocular, buccal, and sublingual) may be formulated as a paste.\nFormulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye drops wherein the active compound is suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active compound.\nFormulations suitable for nasal administration, wherein the carrier is a solid, include a coarse powder having a particle size, for example, in the range of about 20 to about 500 microns which is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e. by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to the nose.\nFormulations suitable for administration by inhalation include those presented as an aerosol spray from a pressurised pack, with the use of a suitable propellant, such as dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichoro-tetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide, or other suitable gases.\nDosage\nIt will be appreciated that appropriate dosages of the active compound, and compositions comprising the active compound, can vary from patient to patient. Determining the optimal dosage will generally involve the balancing of the level of therapeutic benefit against any risk or deleterious side effects of the treatments of the present invention. The selected dosage level will depend on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the activity of the particular compound, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the compound, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds, and/or materials used in combination, and the age, sex, weight, condition, general health, and prior medical history of the patient. The amount of compound and route of administration will ultimately be at the discretion of the physician, although generally the dosage will be to achieve local concentrations at the site of action which achieve the desired effect without causing substantial harmful or deleterious side-effects.\nAdministration in vivo can be effected in one dose, continuously or intermittently (e.g., in divided doses at appropriate intervals) throughout the course of treatment. Methods of determining the most effective means and dosage of administration are well known to those of skill in the art and will vary with the formulation used for therapy, the purpose of the therapy, the target cell being treated, and the subject being treated. Single or multiple administrations can be carried out with the dose level and pattern being selected by the treating physician.\nIn general, a suitable dose of the active compound is in the range of about 10 mg to about 600 mg per m2 body area weight of the subject per day.\nEXAMPLES\nExample 1\nSynthesis of Compound A\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nStarting material (D) was synthesised by the method disclosed in WO 2004/080976\nMethods\nPreparative HPLC\nSamples were purified with a Waters mass-directed purification system utilising a Waters 600 LC pump, Waters Xterra C18 column (5 \u03bcm 19 mm\u00d750 mm) and Micromass ZQ mass spectrometer, operating in positive ion electrospray ionisation mode.

Samples were scanned from 2.5-40\u00b0 2\u03b8 using a 0.03\u00b0 step width typically with a total collection time of 300 s.\nDifferential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)\u2014FIG. 5 \nDSC was recorded using a Mettler DSC820E with TSO801RO robotic system. Typically less than 5 mg of material, contained in a 40 \u03bcl aluminium pan fitted with a pierced lid, was heated over the temperature range 25\u00b0 C. to 325\u00b0 C. at a constant heating rate of 10\u00b0 C. per minute. A nitrogen purge gas was used with flow rate 100 ml per minute.\nExample 6\nInhibitory Action\nIn order to assess the inhibitory action of the active compound, the following assay was used to determine an IC50 value.\nMammalian PARP, isolated from Hela cell nuclear extract, was incubated with Z-buffer (25 mM Hepes (Sigma); 12.5 mM MgCl2 (Sigma); 50 mM KCl (Sigma); 1 mM DTT (Sigma); 10% Glycerol (Sigma) 0.001% NP-40 (Sigma); pH 7.4) in 96 well FlashPlates (TRADE MARK) (NEN, UK) and varying concentrations of said inhibitors added. All compounds were diluted in DMSO and gave final assay concentrations of between 10 and 0.01 \u03bcM, with the DMSO being at a final concentration of 1% per well. The total assay volume per well was 40 \u03bcl.\nAfter 10 minutes incubation at 30\u00b0 C. the reactions were initiated by the addition of a 10 \u03bcl reaction mixture, containing NAD (5 \u03bcM), 3H-NAD and 30 mer double stranded DNA-oligos. Designated positive and negative reaction wells were done in combination with compound wells (unknowns) in order to calculate % enzyme activities. The plates were then shaken for 2 minutes and incubated at 30\u00b0 C. for 45 minutes.\nFollowing the incubation, the reactions were quenched by the addition of 50 \u03bcl 30% acetic acid to each well. The plates were then shaken for 1 hour at room temperature.\nThe plates were transferred to a TopCount NXT (TRADE MARK) (Packard, UK) for scintillation counting. Values recorded are counts per minute (cpm) following a 30 second counting of each well.\nThe % enzyme activity for the compound is then calculated using the following equation:\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\u2062\n\n \n\n\u2062\nInhibition\n\n=\n\n100\n-\n\n(\n\n100\n\u00d7\n\n\n(\n\n\ncpm\n\u2062\n\n \n\n\u2062\nof\n\u2062\n\n \n\n\u2062\nunknowns\n\n-\n\nmean\n\u2062\n\n \n\n\u2062\nnegative\n\u2062\n\n \n\n\u2062\ncpm\n\n\n)\n\n\n(\n\n\nmean\n\u2062\n\n \n\n\u2062\npositive\n\u2062\n\n \n\n\u2062\ncpm\n\n-\n\nmean\n\u2062\n\n \n\n\u2062\nneagative\n\u2062\n\n \n\n\u2062\ncpm\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIC50 values (the concentration at which 50% of the enzyme activity is inhibited) were calculated, which are determined over a range of different concentrations, normally from 10 \u03bcM down to 0.001 \u03bcM. Such IC50 values are used as comparative values to identify increased compound potencies.\nCompound A has an IC50 of about 5 nM.\nPotentiation Factor\nThe Potentiation Factor (PF50) for the active compound is calculated as a ratio of the IC50 of control cell growth divided by the IC50 of cell growth+PARP inhibitor. Growth inhibition curves for both control and compound treated cells are in the presence of the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). The test compound was used at a fixed concentration of 0.2 micromolar. The concentrations of MMS were over a range from 0 to 10 \u03bcg/ml.\nCell growth was assessed using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay (Skehan, P., et al., (1990) New colorimetric cytotoxicity assay for anticancer-drug screening. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 82, 1107-1112.). 2,000 HeLa cells were seeded into each well of a flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plate in a volume of 100 \u03bcl and incubated for 6 hours at 37\u00b0 C. Cells were either replaced with media alone or with media containing PARP inhibitor at a final concentration of 0.5, 1 or 5 \u03bcM.\nCells were allowed to grow for a further 1 hour before the addition of MMS at a range of concentrations (typically 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10 \u03bcg/ml) to either untreated cells or PARP inhibitor treated cells. Cells treated with PARP inhibitor alone were used to assess the growth inhibition by the PARP inhibitor.\nCells were left for a further 16 hours before replacing the media and allowing the cells to grow for a further 72 hours at 37\u00b0 C. The media was then removed and the cells fixed with 100 \u03bcl of ice cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The plates were incubated at 4\u00b0 C. for 20 minutes and then washed four times with water. Each well of cells was then stained with 100 \u03bcl of 0.4% (w/v) SRB in 1% acetic acid for 20 minutes before washing four times with 1% acetic acid. Plates were then dried for 2 hours at room temperature. The dye from the stained cells was solubilized by the addition of 100 \u03bcl of 10 mM Tris Base into each well. Plates were gently shaken and left at room temperature for 30 minutes before measuring the optical density at 564 nM on a Microquant microtiter plate reader.\nCompound A has a PF50 at 200 nM of at least 20.",

        "description": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\nThis application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/829,694, filed Oct. 17, 2006, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\nThe present invention relates to a crystalline form and improved methods of synthesis of a particular phthalazinone derivative, intermediates in the synthesis and pharmaceutical compositions and uses of the crystalline form.\nThe mammalian enzyme PARP (a 113-kDa multidomain protein) has been implicated in the signalling of DNA damage through its ability to recognize and rapidly bind to DNA single or double strand breaks (D'Amours, et al., Biochem. J., 342, 249-268 (1999)).\nSeveral observations have led to the conclusion that PARP participates in a variety of DNA-related functions including gene amplification, cell division, differentiation, apoptosis, DNA base excision repair and also effects on telomere length and chromosome stability (d' Adda di Fagagna, et al., Nature Gen., 23(1), 76-80 (1999)).\nStudies on the mechanism by which PARP modulates DNA repair and other processes has identified its importance in the formation of poly(ADP-ribose) chains within the cellular nucleus (Althaus, F. R. and Richter, C., ADP-Ribosylation of Proteins: Enzymology and Biological Significance, Springer-Verlag, Berlin (1987)). The DNA-bound, activated PARP utilizes NAD to synthesize poly(ADP-ribose) on a variety of nuclear target proteins, including topoisomerase, histones and PARP itself (Rhun, et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 245, 1-10 (1998))\nPoly(ADP-ribosyl)ation has also been associated with malignant transformation. For example, PARP activity is higher in the isolated nuclei of SV40-transformed fibroblasts, while both leukemic cells and colon cancer cells show higher enzyme activity than the equivalent normal leukocytes and colon mucosa (Miwa, et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 181, 313-321 (1977); Burzio, et al., Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med., 149, 933-938 (1975); and Hirai, et al., Cancer Res., 43, 3441-3446 (1983)).\nA number of low-molecular-weight inhibitors of PARP have been used to elucidate the functional role of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in DNA repair. In cells treated with alkylating agents, the inhibition of PARP leads to a marked increase in DNA-strand breakage and cell killing (Durkacz, et al., Nature, 283, 593-596 (1980); Berger, N. A., Radiation Research, 101, 4-14 (1985)).\nSubsequently, such inhibitors have been shown to enhance the effects of radiation response by suppressing the repair of potentially lethal damage (Ben-Hur, et al., British Journal of Cancer, 49 (Suppl. VI), 34-42 (1984); Schlicker, et al., Int. J. Radiat Bioi., 75, 91-100 (1999)). PARP inhibitors have been reported to be effective in radio sensitising hypoxic tumour cells (U.S. Pat. No. 5,032,617; U.S. Pat. No. 5,215,738 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,041,653).\nFurthermore, PARP knockout (PARP \u2212/\u2212) animals exhibit genomic instability in response to alkylating agents and \u03b3-irradiation (Wang, et al., Genes Dev., 9, 509-520 (1995); Menissier de Murcia, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 94, 7303-7307 (1997)).\nA role for PARP has also been demonstrated in certain vascular diseases, septic shock, ischaemic injury and neurotoxicity (Cantoni, et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1014, 1-7 (1989); Szabo, et al., J. Clin. Invest, 100, 723-735 (1997)). Oxygen radical DNA damage that leads to strand breaks in DNA, which are subsequently recognised by PARP, is a major contributing factor to such disease states as shown by PARP inhibitor studies (Cosi, et al., J. Neurosci. Res., 39, 38-46 (1994); Said, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 93, 4688-4692 (1996)). More recently, PARP has been demonstrated to play a role in the pathogenesis of haemorrhagic shock (Liaudet, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 97(3), 10203-10208 (2000)).\nIt has also been demonstrated that efficient retroviral infection of mammalian cells is blocked by the inhibition of PARP activity. Such inhibition of recombinant retroviral vector infections was shown to occur in various different cell types (Gaken, et al., J. Virology, 70(6), 3992-4000 (1996)). Inhibitors of PARP have thus been developed for the use in anti-viral therapies and in cancer treatment (WO 91/18591).\nMoreover, PARP inhibition has been speculated to delay the onset of aging characteristics in human fibroblasts (Rattan and Clark, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm., 201(2), 665-672 (1994)). This may be related to the role that PARP plays in controlling telomere function (d'Adda di Fagagna, et al., Nature Gen., 23(1), 76-80 (1999)).\nWO 2004/080976 discloses a number of phthalazinone derivatives, their activity in inhibiting PARP, and their consequential use in treating cancer, whether as an adjunct to radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or as a stand alone agent.\nWO 2005/053662 describes the use of PARP inhibitors, in particular phthalazinone derivatives, as base excision repair (BER) inhibitors. The use of these inhibitors in the manufacture of medicaments for the treatment of cancers which are deficient in Homologous Recombination (HR) dependent DNA DSB repair activity, in particular for cancers which have a BRCA1 and/or a BRCA2 deficient phenotype, is described.\n4-[3-(4-Cyclopropanecarbonyl-piperazine-1-carbonyl)-4-fluoro-benzyl]-2H-phthalazin-1-one (compound A) disclosed in WO 2004/080976:\n              \nis of particular interest.\n\nIn WO 2004/080976, compound A was synthesised as one of a number of library compounds from 4-[4-fluoro-3-(piperazine-1-carbonyl)-benzyl]-2H-phthalazin-1-one (compound B):\n              \nby the addition of cyclopropanecarbonyl chloride:\n\n              \nto a solution of (B) in dichloromethane, followed by H\u00fcnig's base (N,N-diisopropylethyl amine). This reaction is carried out with stirring at room temperature for 16 hours, and the resulting compound being purified by preparative HPLC.\n\nThe piperazine derivative (B) was prepared by deprotecting 4-[2-fluoro-5-(4-oxo-3,4-dihydro-phthalazin-1-ylmethyl)-benzoyl]-piperazine-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester (compound C):\n              \nby the use of 6M HCl and ethanol for 1 hour, followed by basification with ammonia to pH 9, and extraction into dichloromethane.\n\nThe Boc-protected piperazine derivative (C) was prepared from 2-fluoro-5-(4-oxo-3,4-dihydro-phthalazin-1-ylmethyl)-benzoic acid (compound D):\n              \nby the addition of piperazine-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester:\n\n              \n2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) and N,N,-diisopropylethylamine in dimethylacetamide, followed by stirring for 18 hours.\n\nParticular forms of compound A may have advantageous properties, for example with regard to their solubility and/or their stability and/or their bioavailability and/or their impurity profile and/or their filtration characteristics and/or their drying characteristics and/or their lack of hygroscopicity, and/or they may be easier to handle and/or micronise and/or form into tablets. It is also desired to have an improved method of synthesis that is suitable for synthesis of compound A on a multi-gram scale.\nAccordingly, a first aspect of the present invention provides 4-[3-(4-cyclopropanecarbonyl-piperazine-1-carbonyl)-4-fluoro-benzyl]-2H-phthalazin-1-one (compound A) substantially in crystalline form, and in particular in Form A.\n\u201cSubstantially in crystalline form\u201d as used above, means that at least 50% by weight of compound A is in crystalline form, preferably at least 70% by weight, 80% or 90% by weight. In some embodiments, at least 95% by weight, 99% by weight or even 99.5% or more by weight may be in crystalline form.\nCompound A as crystalline Form A has an X-ray diffraction pattern (\u03bb=1.5418 \u212b) containing specific peaks at:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \nPeak\n2\u03b8\u00b0 (\u00b10.1\u00b0)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n1\n12.0\n\n\n \n2\n17.8\n\n\n \n3\n21.1\n\n\n \n4\n22.3\n\n\n \n5\n29.2\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound A as crystalline form A may also have the following additional peaks an X-ray diffraction pattern (\u03bb=1.5418 \u212b):\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \nPeak\n2\u03b8\u00b0 (\u00b10.1\u00b0)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n6\n10.5\n\n\n \n7\n14.0\n\n\n \n8\n21.7\n\n\n \n9\n24.3\n\n\n \n10\n26.1\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound A as crystalline Form A may also be characterised by any combination of three or more peaks selected from the list of 10 peaks above.\nA representative powder XRD pattern of compound A as Form A is shown in FIG. 3.\nWithout wishing to be bound by theory, compound A is able to readily form a structure in which solvent molecules can occupy positions within the crystal lattice. Such solvates, not necessarily stoichiometric in nature, can consist of one pure solvate (e.g. Compound A methanolate, and Compound A Tetrahydrofuranate) or potentially can consist of more than one solvent component (e.g. methanol and di-ethyl ether). The solvent molecules typically lie within pockets created by the Compound A molecules. In certain circumstances, the volume of these pockets are sufficiently flexible to incorporate a range of solvents, resulting in little change in the overall structure of the material, and hence only small shifts in the XRPD reflections.\nSolvates, including those which share the same overall structure, arise from solution maturation and crystallisation experiments from dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, 2-butanone, t-butyl methyl ether, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, water, cyclohexane, cyclopropyl methyl ketone, 1,2 dichloroethane, ethyl trifluoroacetate, fluorobenzenehexafluoro-iso-propanol, methyl nonafluorobutyl ether, 2-methyl-1-propanol, nitromethane, propionitrile, trichloroethylene, \u03b1\u03b1\u03b1-trifluorotoluene, heptane, dioxane, acetonitrile, either as pure solvents or when combined with another solvent. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the most common solvate structure is shown in FIG. 4, and typically contains most intense peaks at positions listed below:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n2\u03b8\u00b0 (\u00b10.1\u00b0)\n\n\n \nPeak\n(\u03bb = 1.5418 \u212b)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n1\n7.0-7.5\n\n\n \n2\n10.1-10.6\n\n\n \n3\n15.1-15.6\n\n\n \n4\n18.5-19.0\n\n\n \n5\n21.0-21.5\n\n\n \n6\n24.8-25.3\n\n\n \n7\n27.0-27.5\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will be understood that the relative intensities of peaks shown in the figures may vary according to the orientation of the sample under test and on the type and setting of the instrument used so that the intensities in the XRD traces included herein are illustrative and not intended to be used for absolute comparison.\nForm A of compound A is substantially free from solvent. The term \u201csubstantially free from solvent\u201d as used herein refers to the form having only insignificant amounts of any solvent, e.g. a form with a total of 0.5% by weight or less of any solvent. The total amount of any solvent, including water, may be 0.25%, 0.1%, 0.05% or 0.025% by weight or less.\nForm A of compound A may also be characterised using DSC. Form A of compound A when heated from 25\u00b0 C. to 325\u00b0 C. at 10\u00b0 C. per minute will begin melting at 210.1\u00b0 C.\u00b11\u00b0 C. A representative DSC trace for compound A as Form A is shown in FIG. 5.\nThe second aspect of the present invention provides a method of obtaining 4-[3-(4-cyclopropanecarbonyl-piperazine-1-carbonyl)-4-fluoro-benzyl]-2H-phthalazin-1-one (compound A) as crystalline Form A which comprises crystallising compound A in a solvent and then displacing the solvent from the crystalline form with a displacing agent. The displacing agent may be water or a mixture of a C1-2 alcohol and water.\nIn a first embodiment, this method comprises the steps of:\n(i) crystallising 4-[3-(4-cyclopropanecarbonyl-piperazine-1-carbonyl)-4-fluoro-benzyl]-2H-phthalazin-1-one (compound A) from a solvent;\n(ii) if the original solvent is not ethanol, treating the crystalline compound A with ethanol;\n(iii) treating the crystalline compound A with water to remove trapped ethanol;\n(iv) drying the resulting product.\nThe solvent used in the original crystallisation may be, for example, dichloromethane or acetonitrile.\nThe methods for obtaining Form A may generally involve solvent replacement. It has been found that compound A crystallises in such a way that channels in the crystal lattice are formed which can trap solvents, thus making them difficult to remove.\nThe method of the first embodiment can be used in particular if the solvent used in the crystallisation of compound A is dichloromethane. The step of exchanging the dichloromethane as a solvent with ethanol as a solvent can be carried out by distilling the solution of compound A at atmospheric pressure in the presence of ethanol. The exchange is complete when the head temperature approaches the boiling point of ethanol, e.g. at least 73\u00b0 C. In particular, the exchange may be carried out by distilling out the majority of the DCM, then adding a volume of ethanol. The distillation is then continued, with replacing batches of distillate with equal volumes of ethanol.\nCrystallising compound A from the ethanol solvent may be carried out by cooling the solution to below 15\u00b0 C., preferably less than 10\u00b0 C., and more preferably to about 8\u00b0 C. The crystals of compound A may then be removed from solution by filtration.\nThe crystalline compound A may be treated with water to remove trapped ethanol by suspended the crystalline material in water and heating at reflux for a sufficient time, for example at least three hours, and preferably for about four hours. The crystalline compound A may be removed from suspension in water by filtration.\nDrying the resulting product of the above step is readily achieved. For example, by heating the product in an oven at a temperature of at least 60\u00b0 C., preferably at about 70\u00b0 C.\nIn another such embodiment, the method comprises the steps of:\n(i) obtaining compound A as crystalline form containing solvent;\n(ii) if the original solvent used in the synthesis of compound A in the crystalline form is not a mixture of water and a C1-2 alcohol (i.e. methanol, ethanol), treating compound A in the crystalline form with a mixture of water and a C1-2 alcohol;\n(ii) drying the resulting product.\nThe resulting product can be further treated with a mixture of water and a C1-2 alcohol, and dried in order to further isolate compound A in a crystalline Form A.\nThe mixture of water and C1-2 alcohol is preferably in the range of 2:1 to 1:2 by volume, and more preferably 1.5:1 to 1:1.5 by volume. A particularly preferred mixture is 1 part water to 1.2 parts C1-2 alcohol. Another particularly preferred mixture is 2 parts water to 1 part C1-2 alcohol. The C1-2 alcohol is preferably ethanol.\nCompound A as crystalline Form may be obtained by crystallisation of the compound A from a solvent, as described above.\nThe solvent treatment in step (ii) may be carried out by suspending compound A in the mixture of water and C1-2 alcohol and heating to reflux with stirring. This may be followed by cooling to between 55 and 65\u00b0 C. and filtering, e.g. through a celite pad. The filter pad may be washed with a mixture of water and C1-2 alcohol before being distilled at ambient pressure (usually 1 atm), or above. The distillation may be stopped to yield a suspension that is left at room temperature before subsequent filtration. The resulting filter cake may be washed with water.\nDrying the resulting product of the above step is readily achieved. For example, by heating the product in an oven at a temperature of at least 50\u00b0 C., preferably at about 60\u00b0 C.\nThe further treatment may proceed in a similar manner to that described above.\nIn a third embodiment, the method comprises:\n(i) suspending compound A in a mixture of water and a C1-2 alcohol as the solvent;\n(ii) heating the suspension to reflux;\n(iii) cooling the solution and seeding with compound A as Form A;\n(iv) drying the resulting product.\nThe resulting product can be further treated with a mixture of water and a C1-2 alcohol, and dried in order to further isolate compound A in a crystalline Form A.\nThe mixture of water and C1-2 alcohol is preferably in the range of 2:1 to 1:5 by volume, and more preferably 1:2 to 1:4 by volume. A particularly preferred mixture is 1 part water to 3 parts C1-2 alcohol. The C1-2 alcohol is preferably ethanol.\nStep (iii) may comprise cooling the solution to between 65 and 75\u00b0 C. (e.g. 70\u00b0 C.) and filtering, e.g. through a celite pad. The filter pad may be washed with a mixture of water and C1-2 alcohol before being distilled (e.g. at ambient pressure, or above). The seeding may occur after the resulting filtrate has been cooled to between 40 and 50\u00b0 C. (e.g. 45\u00b0 C.). The resulting suspension may be cooled to ambient temperature (e.g. 20\u00b0 C.) in between 2 and 3 hours (e.g. 2.5 hours) and maintained at said temperature for long enough to establish crystallisation. This may be between 12 and 24 hours, and may be for about 16 hours. At the end of this period, further water may be added. The amount may be about equal to the volume of total solvent (water and C1-2 alcohol) present and may be added slowly, for example over a period of 4 to 6 (e.g. 5) hours. The suspension may be held at ambient temperature after the water addition, for example for 2 hours.\nThe suspension may then be filtered, and the resulting filter cake may be washed with a mixture of C1-2 alcohol and water (in a ratio of between 1:3 and 1:2, e.g. 1:2.3).\nDrying the resulting product of the above step is readily achieved. For example, by heating the product in an oven under vacuum at a temperature of between 40 and 60\u00b0 C.\nA third aspect of the present invention provides a method of synthesising compound A from compound B comprising the step of:\n    (i) adding a pre-mixed solution of triethylamine and cyclopropane carbonyl chloride, in an appropriate organic solvent (for example, DCM (dichloromethane)) in a controlled manner, to compound B in the same organic solvent with the temperature of the solution being controlled to be below 20\u00b0 C.   \nIn some embodiments, the method further comprises the step of:\n    (ii) agitating (e.g. stirring) the resulting solution from (i) until the reaction is complete, whilst maintaining the temperature of the solution below 20\u00b0 C.   \nThe addition in step (i) may take place in a dropwise manner\nThis method is more controlled than that described in WO 2004/080976, resulting in a more regioselective addition of the acid chloride. The less controlled method of the prior art can lead to addition of the acid chloride at the phthalazinone nitrogen and or oxygen, as well as at the desired piperidine nitrogen.\nIt is preferred that the above method is carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere.\nIt is further preferred that the temperature of the solution in stage (ii) is maintained between 10 and 15\u00b0 C.\nThe product of the above reaction is preferably worked up by at least one water washing step. More preferably the work up contains an initial and final water washing steps, and intermediate washing steps using a dilute acid, e.g. 5% citric acid solution, followed by a dilute base, e.g. 5% sodium carbonate solution.\nA fourth aspect of the present invention provides a method of synthesising compound A from compound D comprising reacting compound D with 1-(cyclopropylcarbonyl)piperazine, or a mineral acid salt thereof, in the presence of an amide coupling agent and a base, for example, an amine (e.g. a tertiary amine, such as diisopropylethylamine).\nThe mineral acid salt may be, for example, the hydrochloride salt.\nThe addition of 1-(cyclopropylcarbonyl)piperazine, or a mineral acid salt thereof, to compound D may be carried out in any suitable solvent, for example, acetonitrile. The amide coupling agent is preferably 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU). It is preferably added to the solution of 1-(cyclopropylcarbonyl)piperazine, or its mineral acid salt, diisopropylethylamine and compound D over a period of time, for example 30 minutes. The temperature of the resulting solution may be maintained at 25\u00b0 C. or below (or 20\u00b0 C. or below, e.g. at 18\u00b0 C.). After its addition, the resulting solution may be left to stand for a period of time. A preferred temperature regime is holding the solution at room temperature for 2 hours.\nThe resulting compound A may be removed from the solution by cooling to below 10\u00b0 C. (or below 5\u00b0 C., for example, 3\u00b0 C.) for a period of time (e.g. 1 hour), followed by filtration. The resulting compound A may be washed, for example, with cold acetonitrile.\nIn WO 2004/080976, the following route to compound D is disclosed:\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nDimethyl phosphite was added drop-wise to a solution of sodium methoxide in methanol at 0\u00b0 C. 2-Carboxybenzaldehyde (H) was then added portion-wise to the reaction mixture as a slurry in methanol, with the temperature kept below 5\u00b0 C. The resulting pale yellow solution was warmed to 20\u00b0 C. over 1 hour. Methanesulphonic acid was added to the reaction drop-wise and the resulting white suspension was evaporated in vacuo. The white residue was quenched with water and extracted into chloroform. The combined organic extracts were washed with water, dried over MgSO4, and evaporated in vacuo to yield (3-oxo-1,3-dihydro-isobenzofuran-1-yl)phosphonic acid dimethyl ester (G) as a white solid (yield: 95%). This was then used without further purification in the next stage.\nTo a mixture of (3-oxo-1,3-dihydro-isobenzofuran-1-yl)phosphonic acid dimethyl ester (G) in tetrahydrofuran and 2-fluoro-5-formylbenzonitrile (F) in tetrahydrofuran was added triethylamine drop-wise over 25 min, with the temperature kept below 15\u00b0 C. The reaction mixture was warmed slowly to 20\u00b0 C. over 1 hour and concentrated in vacuo. The white residue was slurried in water or 30 minutes, filtered, washed with water, hexane and ether, and dried to yield 2-fluoro-5-(3-oxo-3H-isobenzofuran-1-ylidenemethyl)benzonitrile (E) as a 50:50 mixture of E and Z isomers (yield: 96%).\nTo a suspension of 2-fluoro-5-(3-oxo-3H-isobenzofuran-1-ylidenemethyl)benzonitrile (E) in water was added aqueous sodium hydroxide solution and the reaction mixture was heated under nitrogen to 90\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes. The reaction mixture was partially cooled to 70\u00b0 C., and hydrazine hydrate was added and stirred for 18 hours at 70\u00b0 C. The reaction was cooled to room temperature and acidified with 2M HCl to pH 4. The mixture was stirred for 10 minutes and filtered. The resulting solid was washed with water, hexane, ether, ethyl acetate and dried to yield compound D as a pale pink powder (yield: 77%).\nIt is also desired to have an improved method of synthesis of compound D.\nAccordingly a fifth aspect of the present invention provides a method synthesising compound D, comprising the step of:\n(a) synthesising diethyl (3-oxo-1,3-dihydro-2-benzofuran-1-yl)phosphonate (G\u2032) from 2-carboxybenzaldehyde (H);\n(b) synthesising 2-fluoro-5-[(E/Z)-(3-oxo-2-benzofuran-1(3H)-ylidene)methyl]benzonitrile (E) from diethyl (3-oxo-1,3-dihydro-2-benzofuran-1-yl)phosphonate.\nIt is preferred that compound G\u2032 is not isolated in the synthesis. This method avoids the use of the sodium salt of dimethylphosphite which is unstable (Pelchowicz, et al., J. Chem. Soc, 4348-4350 (1961)) in alcoholic solution. It is preferred that the step (a) occurs in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran in which the sodium salt of diethyl phosphite is stable. This salt may be formed in situ by adding diethyl phosphite to a cooled solution of sodium t-amylate in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran. The reaction with the sodium salt of diethyl phosphite may be followed by reaction with methanesulphonic acid.\nStep (b) may be carried out in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, with the addition of triethylamine.\nThe method of synthesising compound D may further comprise the step of:\n(c) synthesising 2-fluoro-5-[(4-oxo-3,4-dihydrophthalazin-1-yl)methyl]benzonitrile (ED):\n              \nfrom compound E by reaction with hydrazine hydrate; and\n\n(d) synthesising compound D from compound ED by reaction with sodium hydroxide.\n\nStep (c) may be achieved by using between 1.1 and 1.3 equivalents of hydrazine hydrate in tetrahydrofuran followed by neutralisation of the excess hydrazine hydrate using acetic acid.\nA sixth aspect of the present invention provides the compound ED:\n              \nand its use in the synthesis of compound D.\n\nA further aspect of the invention provides a mineral acid salt of 1-(cyclopropylcarbonyl)piperazine, and a method of synthesis thereof by reacting piperazine with acetic acid, followed by addition of cyclopropanecarbonyl chloride.\nA seventh aspect of the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the first aspect and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.\nAn eighth aspect of the present invention provides a compound of the first aspect for use in a method of treatment of the human or animal body.\nA ninth aspect of the present invention provides the use of a compound as defined in the first aspect of the invention in the preparation of a medicament for inhibiting the activity of PARP.\nFurther aspects of the invention provide the use of a compound as defined in the first aspect of the invention in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of: vascular disease; septic shock; ischaemic injury; neurotoxicity; haemorraghic shock; viral infection; or diseases ameliorated by the inhibition of the activity of PARP.\nAnother further aspect of the invention provides for the use of a compound as defined in the first aspect of the invention in the preparation of a medicament for use as an adjunct in cancer therapy or for potentiating tumour cells for treatment with ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic agents.\nOther further aspects of the invention provide for the treatment of disease ameliorated by the inhibition of PARP, comprising administering to a subject in need of treatment a therapeutically-effective amount of a compound as defined in the first aspect, preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition and the treatment of cancer, comprising administering to a subject in need of treatment a therapeutically-effective amount of a compound as defined in the first aspect in combination, preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, simultaneously or sequentially with ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic agents.\nIn further aspects of the present invention, the compounds may be used in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of cancer which is deficient in Homologous Recombination (HR) dependent DNA DSB repair activity, or in the treatment of a patient of a cancer which is deficient in HR dependent DNA DSB repair activity, comprising administering to said patient a therapeutically-effective amount of the compound.\nThe HR dependent DNA DSB repair pathway repairs double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA via homologous mechanisms to reform a continuous DNA helix (K. K. Khanna and S. P. Jackson, Nat. Genet. 27(3): 247-254 (2001)). The components of the HR dependent DNA DSB repair pathway include, but are not limited to, ATM (NM\u2014000051), RAD51 (NM\u2014002875), RAD51L1 (NM\u2014002877), RAD51C (NM\u2014002876), RAD51L3 (NM\u2014002878), DMC1 (NM\u2014007068), XRCC2 (NM\u2014005431), XRCC3 (NM\u2014005432), RAD52 (NM\u2014002879), RAD54L (NM\u2014003579), RAD54B (NM\u2014012415), BRCA1 (NM\u2014007295), BRCA2 (NM\u2014000059), RAD50 (NM\u2014005732), MRE11A (NM\u2014005590) and NBS1 (NM\u2014002485). Other proteins involved in the HR dependent DNA DSB repair pathway include regulatory factors such as EMSY (Hughes-Davies, et al., Cell, 115, pp 523-535). HR components are also described in Wood, et al., Science, 291, 1284-1289 (2001).\nA cancer which is deficient in HR dependent DNA DSB repair may comprise or consist of one or more cancer cells which have a reduced or abrogated ability to repair DNA DSBs through that pathway, relative to normal cells i.e. the activity of the HR dependent DNA DSB repair pathway may be reduced or abolished in the one or more cancer cells.\nThe activity of one or more components of the HR dependent DNA DSB repair pathway may be abolished in the one or more cancer cells of an individual having a cancer which is deficient in HR dependent DNA DSB repair. Components of the HR dependent DNA DSB repair pathway are well characterised in the art (see for example, Wood, et al., Science, 291, 1284-1289 (2001)) and include the components listed above.\nIn some preferred embodiments, the cancer cells may have a BRCA1 and/or a BRCA2 deficient phenotype i.e. BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 activity is reduced or abolished in the cancer cells. Cancer cells with this phenotype may be deficient in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2, i.e. expression and/or activity of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 may be reduced or abolished in the cancer cells, for example by means of mutation or polymorphism in the encoding nucleic acid, or by means of amplification, mutation or polymorphism in a gene encoding a regulatory factor, for example the EMSY gene which encodes a BRCA2 regulatory factor (Hughes-Davies, et al., Cell, 115, 523-535).\nBRCA1 and BRCA2 are known tumour suppressors whose wild-type alleles are frequently lost in tumours of heterozygous carriers (Jasin M., Oncogene, 21(58), 8981-93 (2002); Tutt, et al., Trends Mol. Med., 8(12), 571-6, (2002)). The association of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutations with breast cancer is well-characterised in the art (Radice, P. J., Exp Clin Cancer Res., 21(3 Suppl), 9-12 (2002)). Amplification of the EMSY gene, which encodes a BRCA2 binding factor, is also known to be associated with breast and ovarian cancer.\nCarriers of mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 are also at elevated risk of cancer of the ovary, prostate and pancreas.\nIn some preferred embodiments, the individual is heterozygous for one or more variations, such as mutations and polymorphisms, in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 or a regulator thereof. The detection of variation in BRCA1 and BRCA2 is well-known in the art and is described, for example in EP 699 754, EP 705 903, Neuhausen, S. L. and Ostrander, E. A., Genet. Test, 1, 75-83 (1992); Chappnis, P. O. and Foulkes, W. D., Cancer Treat Res, 107, 29-59 (2002); Janatova M., et al., Neoplasma, 50(4), 246-50 (2003); Jancarkova, N., Ceska Gynekol., 68(1), 11-6 (2003)). Determination of amplification of the BRCA2 binding factor EMSY is described in Hughes-Davies, et al., Cell, 115, 523-535).\nMutations and polymorphisms associated with cancer may be detected at the nucleic acid level by detecting the presence of a variant nucleic acid sequence or at the protein level by detecting the presence of a variant (i.e. a mutant or allelic variant) polypeptide.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES\n FIG. 1 shows the NMR of compound A after water treatment (example 1);\n FIG. 2 shows the powder XRD pattern of compound A as Form A after water treatment (example 1);\n FIG. 3 shows a representative powder XRD pattern of compound A as Form A;\n FIG. 4 shows a representative powder XRD pattern of compound A as solvated form;\n FIG. 5 shows a representative DSC trace of compound A as Form A obtained by heating from 25\u00b0 C. to 325\u00b0 C. at 10\u00b0 C. per minute.\n\nUSE\nThe present invention provides compound A as Form A as an active compound, specifically, active in inhibiting the activity of PARP.\nThe term \u201cactive\u201d as used herein, pertains to the compound which is capable of inhibiting PARP activity. One assay which may conveniently be used in order to assess the PARP inhibition offered by the compound is described in the examples below.\nThe present invention further provides a method of inhibiting the activity of PARP in a cell, comprising contacting said cell with an effective amount of the active compound, preferably in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable composition. Such a method may be practised in vitro or in vivo.\nFor example, a sample of cells may be grown in vitro and the active compound brought into contact with said cells, and the effect of the compound on those cells observed. As examples of \u201ceffect\u201d, the amount of DNA repair effected in a certain time may be determined. Where the active compound is found to exert an influence on the cells, this may be used as a prognostic or diagnostic marker of the efficacy of the compound in methods of treating a patient carrying cells of the same cellular type.\nThe term \u201ctreatment\u201d, as used herein in the context of treating a condition, pertains generally to treatment and therapy, whether of a human or an animal (e.g. in veterinary applications), in which some desired therapeutic effect is achieved, for example, the inhibition of the progress of the condition, and includes a reduction in the rate of progress, a halt in the rate of progress, amelioration of the condition, and cure of the condition. Treatment as a prophylactic measure (i.e. prophylaxis) is also included.\nThe term \u201cadjunct\u201d as used herein relates to the use of the active compound in conjunction with known therapeutic means. Such means include cytotoxic regimes of drugs and/or ionising radiation as used in the treatment of different cancer types. In particular, the active compounds are known to potentiate the actions of a number of cancer chemotherapy treatments, which include the topoisomerase class of poisons (e.g. topotecan, irinotecan, rubitecan), most of the known alkylating agents (e.g. DTIC, temozolamide) and platinum based drugs (e.g. carboplatin, cisplatin) used in treating cancer.\nThe active compound may also be used as cell culture additives to inhibit PARP, for example, in order to sensitize cells to known chemotherapeutic agents or ionising radiation treatments in vitro.\nThe active compound may also be used as part of an in vitro assay, for example, in order to determine whether a candidate host is likely to benefit from treatment with the compound in question.\nAdministration\nThe active compound or pharmaceutical composition comprising the active compound may be administered to a subject by any convenient route of administration, whether systemically/peripherally or at the site of desired action, including but not limited to, oral (e.g. by ingestion); topical (including e.g. transdermal, intranasal, ocular, buccal, and sublingual); pulmonary (e.g. by inhalation or insufflation therapy using, e.g. an aerosol, e.g. through mouth or nose); rectal; vaginal; parenteral, for example, by injection, including subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intracardiac, intrathecal, intraspinal, intracapsular, subcapsular, intraorbital, intraperitoneal, intratracheal, subcuticular, intraarticular, subarachnoid, and intrasternal; by implant of a depot, for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly.\nThe subject may be a eukaryote, an animal, a vertebrate animal, a mammal, a rodent (e.g. a guinea pig, a hamster, a rat, a mouse), murine (e.g. a mouse), canine (e.g. a dog), feline (e.g. a cat), equine (e.g. a horse), a primate, simian (e.g. a monkey or ape), a monkey (e.g. marmoset, baboon), an ape (e.g. gorilla, chimpanzee, orangutan, gibbon), or a human.\nFormulations\nWhile it is possible for the active compound to be administered alone, it is preferable to present it as a pharmaceutical composition (e.g., formulation) comprising the active compound, as defined above, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, excipients, diluents, fillers, buffers, stabilisers, preservatives, lubricants, or other materials well known to those skilled in the art and optionally other therapeutic or prophylactic agents.\nThus, the present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions, as defined above, and methods of making a pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing the active compound, as defined above, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, buffers, adjuvants, stabilisers, or other materials, as described herein, such that active compound remains as crystalline Form A.\nThe term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d as used herein pertains to compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgement, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of a subject (e.g. human) without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Each carrier, excipient, etc. must also be \u201cacceptable\u201d in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation.\nSuitable carriers, diluents, excipients, etc. can be found in standard pharmaceutical texts. See, for example, \u201cHandbook of Pharmaceutical Additives\u201d, 2nd Edition (eds. M. Ash and 1. Ash), 2001 (Synapse Information Resources, Inc., Endicott, N.Y., USA), \u201cRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences\u201d, 20th edition, pub. Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, 2000; and \u201cHandbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients\u201d, 2nd edition, 1994.\nThe formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active compound with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active compound with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then if necessary shaping the product.\nFormulations may be in the form of suspensions, tablets, granules, powders, capsules, cachets, pills or pastes.\nFormulations suitable for oral administration (e.g., by ingestion) may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of the active compound; as a powder or granules; as a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; or as a paste.\nA tablet may be made by conventional means, e.g. compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active compound in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with one or more binders (e.g. povidone, gelatin, acacia, sorbitol, tragacanth, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose); fillers or diluents (e.g. lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, calcium hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (e.g. magnesium stearate, talc, silica); disintegrants (e.g. sodium starch glycolate, cross-linked povidone, cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose); surface-active or dispersing or wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulfate); and preservatives (e.g., methyl p-hydroxybenzoate, propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, sorbic acid). Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active compound therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile. Tablets may optionally be provided with an enteric coating, to provide release in parts of the gut other than the stomach.\nA capsule may include the active compound in suspension.\nFormulations suitable for topical administration (e.g. transdermal, intranasal, ocular, buccal, and sublingual) may be formulated as a paste.\nFormulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye drops wherein the active compound is suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active compound.\nFormulations suitable for nasal administration, wherein the carrier is a solid, include a coarse powder having a particle size, for example, in the range of about 20 to about 500 microns which is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e. by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to the nose.\nFormulations suitable for administration by inhalation include those presented as an aerosol spray from a pressurised pack, with the use of a suitable propellant, such as dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichloro-tetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide, or other suitable gases.\nDosage\nIt will be appreciated that appropriate dosages of the active compound, and compositions comprising the active compound, can vary from patient to patient. Determining the optimal dosage will generally involve the balancing of the level of therapeutic benefit against any risk or deleterious side effects of the treatments of the present invention. The selected dosage level will depend on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the activity of the particular compound, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the compound, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds, and/or materials used in combination, and the age, sex, weight, condition, general health, and prior medical history of the patient. The amount of compound and route of administration will ultimately be at the discretion of the physician, although generally the dosage will be to achieve local concentrations at the site of action which achieve the desired effect without causing substantial harmful or deleterious side-effects.\nAdministration in vivo can be effected in one dose, continuously or intermittently (e.g., in divided doses at appropriate intervals) throughout the course of treatment. Methods of determining the most effective means and dosage of administration are well known to those of skill in the art and will vary with the formulation used for therapy, the purpose of the therapy, the target cell being treated, and the subject being treated. Single or multiple administrations can be carried out with the dose level and pattern being selected by the treating physician.\nIn general, a suitable dose of the active compound is in the range of about 10 mg to about 600 mg per m2 body area weight of the subject per day.\nEXAMPLES\nExample 1\nSynthesis of Compound A\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nStarting material (D) was synthesised by the method disclosed in WO 2004/080976\nMethods\nPreparative HPLC\nSamples were purified with a Waters mass-directed purification system utilising a Waters 600 LC pump, Waters Xterra C18 column (5 \u03bcm 19 mm\u00d750 mm) and Micromass ZQ mass spectrometer, operating in positive ion electrospray ionisation mode. Mobile phases A (0.1% formic acid in water) and B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) were used in a gradient; 5% B to 100% over 7 min, held for 3 min, at a flow rate of 20 ml/min.\nAnalytical HPLC-MS\nAnalytical HPLC was carried out with a Spectra System P4000 pump and Jones Genesis C18 column (4 \u03bcm, 50 mm\u00d74.6 mm). Mobile phases A (0.1% formic acid in water) and B (acetonitrile) were used in a gradient of 5% B for 1 min rising to 98% B after 5 min, held for 3 min at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Detection was by a TSP UV 6000LP detector at 254 nm UV and range 210-600 nm PDA. The Mass spectrometer was a Finnigan LCQ operating in positive ion electrospray mode.\nNMR\n 1H NMR spectra were recorded using Bruker DPX 300 spectrometer at 300 MHz. Chemical shifts were reported in parts per million (ppm) on the \u03b4 scale relative to tetramethylsilane internal standard.

All compounds were diluted in DMSO and gave final assay concentrations of between 10 and 0.01 \u03bcM, with the DMSO being at a final concentration of 1% per well. The total assay volume per well was 40 \u03bcl.\nAfter 10 minutes incubation at 30\u00b0 C. the reactions were initiated by the addition of a 10 \u03bcl reaction mixture, containing NAD (5 \u03bcM), 3H-NAD and 30mer double stranded DNA-oligos. Designated positive and negative reaction wells were done in combination with compound wells (unknowns) in order to calculate % enzyme activities.

Such IC50 values are used as comparative values to identify increased compound potencies.\nCompound A has an IC50 of about 5 nM.\nPotentiation Factor\nThe Potentiation Factor (PF50) for the active compound is calculated as a ratio of the IC50 of control cell growth divided by the IC50 of cell growth+PARP inhibitor.

The test compound was used at a fixed concentration of 0.2 micromolar.

Cells were either replaced with media alone or with media containing PARP inhibitor at a final concentration of 0.5, 1 or 5 \u03bcM. Cells were allowed to grow for a further 1 hour before the addition of MMS at a range of concentrations (typically 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10 \u03bcg/ml) to either untreated cells or PARP inhibitor treated cells. Cells treated with PARP inhibitor alone were used to assess the growth inhibition by the PARP inhibitor.\nCells were left for a further 16 hours before replacing the media and allowing the cells to grow for a further 72 hours at 37\u00b0 C. The media was then removed and the cells fixed with 100 \u03bcl of ice cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The plates were incubated at 4\u00b0 C. for 20 minutes and then washed four times with water. Each well of cells was then stained with 100 \u03bcl of 0.4% (w/v) SRB in 1% acetic acid for 20 minutes before washing four times with 1% acetic acid.

Also provided are pharmaceutical compositions containing the combinations.\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\nIn response to cellular stresses including heat, toxins, radiation, infection, inflammation, and oxidants, all cells produce a common set of heat shock proteins (Hsps) (Macario & de Macario 2000). Most heat shock proteins act as molecular chaperones. Chaperones bind and stabilize proteins at intermediate stages of folding and allow proteins to fold to their functional states. Hsp90 is the most abundant cytosolic Hsp under normal conditions. There are two human isoforms of Hsp90, a major inducible form Hsp90\u03b1 and minor constitutively expressed form Hsp90\u03b2 and two other closely related chaperones which are restricted in their intracellular location (Endoplasmic reticulum GP96/GRP94; mitochondrial TRAP1). The term HSP90 as used here includes all these analogues unless stated. Hsp90 binds proteins at a late stage of folding and is distinguished from other Hsps in that most of its protein substrates are involved in signal transduction. Hsp90 has a distinct ATP binding site, including a Bergerat fold characteristic of bacterial gyrase, topoisomerases and histidine kinases. It has been shown that ATP bound at the N-terminal pocket of Hsp90 is hydrolysed. This ATPase activity results in a conformational change in Hsp90 that is required to enable conformational changes in the client protein.\nA dimerization domain and a second ATP binding site, which may regulate ATPase activity, is found near the c-terminus of Hsp90. Dimerization of HSP90 appears critical for ATP hydrolysis. Activation of Hsp90 is further regulated through interactions with a variety of other chaperone proteins and can be isolated in complex with other chaperones including Hsp70, Hip, Hop, p23, and p50cdc37. Many other co-chaperone proteins have also been demonstrated to bind HSP90. A simplified model has emerged in which ATP binding to the amino terminal pocket alters Hsp90 conformation to allow association with a multichaperone complex. First the client protein is bound to an Hsp70/Hsp40 complex. This complex then associates with Hsp90 via Hop. When ADP is replaced by ATP, the conformation of Hsp90 is altered, Hop and Hsp70 are released and a different set of co-chaperones is recruited including p50cdc37 and p23. ATP hydrolysis results in the release of these co-chaperones and the client protein from the mature complex. Ansamycin antibiotics herbimycin, geldanamycin (GA) and 17-allylamino-17-desmethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) are ATP binding site inhibitors that block the binding of ATP and prevent conversion to the mature complex (Grenert et. al., 1997. J Biol. Chem., 272:23834-23850).\nDespite Hsp90 being ubiquitously expressed, GA has a higher binding affinity for Hsp90 derived from tumour vs. normal cell lines (Kamal et. al., Nature 2003; 425: 407-410). GA also shows more potent cytotoxic activity in tumour cells and is sequestered at higher concentrations within tumours in xenograft mouse models (Brazidec J. Med. Chem. 2004, 47, 3865-3873). Furthermore the ATP-ase activity of Hsp90 is elevated in cancer cells and is an indication of the increased level of stress in these cells. Hsp90 gene amplification has also been reported to occur in the later stages of cancer (Jolly and Morimoto JNCI Vol. 92, No. 19, 1564-1572, 2000).\nIncreased genetic instability associated with the cancer phenotype leads to an increase in the production of non-native or mutant proteins. The ubiquitin pathway also serves to protect the cell from non-native or misfolded proteins, by targeting these proteins for proteasomal degradation. Mutant proteins are by their nature not native and therefore have the potential to show structural instability and an increased requirement for the chaperone system. (Giannini et al., Mol Cell Biol. 2004; 24(13):5667-76).\nThere is some evidence that Hsp90 is found primarily within \u201cactivated\u201d multichaperone complexes in the tumour cells as opposed to \u201clatent\u201d complexes in normal cells. One component of the multichaperone complex is the cdc37 co-chaperone. Cdc37 binds Hsp90 at the base of the ATP binding site and could affect the off rates of inhibitors bound to Hsp90 in the \u201cactivated\u201d state (Roe et. al., Cell 116, (2004), pp. 87-98). The client protein bound to the Hsp90-Hsp70 form of the chaperone complex is believed to be more susceptible to ubiquitination and targeting to the proteasome for degradation. E3 ubiquitin ligases have been identified with chaperone interacting motifs and one of these (CHIP) was shown to promote the ubiquitination and degradation of Hsp90 client proteins (Connell et al., 2001. Xu et al., 2002).\nHsp90 Client Proteins\nThe number of reported Hsp90 client proteins now exceeds 100. Since many of its client proteins are involved in cell signalling proliferation and survival, Hsp90 has received major interest as an oncology target. Two groups of client proteins, cell signalling protein kinases and transcription factors, in particular suggest Hsp90 regulation may have potential benefit as an anticancer therapy.\nHsp90 protein kinase client proteins implicated in cell proliferation and survival include the following:\nc-Src\nCellular Src (c-Src) is a receptor tyrosine kinase, required for mitogenesis initiated by multiple growth factor receptors, including the receptors for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1R), and the basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGFR). C-Src is also overexpressed and activated in many of the same human carcinomas that overexpress EGFR and ErbB2. Src is also required for the maintenance of normal bone homeostasis through its regulation of osteoclast function.\np185erbB2\nErbB2 (Her2/neu) is a receptor tyrosine kinase overexpressed in a variety of malignancies including breast, ovarian, prostate, and gastric cancers. ErbB2 was originally identified as an oncogene and inhibition of Hsp90 results in the polyubiquitination and degradation of erbB2.\nPolo Mitotic Kinase\nPolo-like kinases (Plks) are important regulators of cell cycle progression during M-phase. Plks are involved in the assembly of the mitotic spindle apparatus and in the activation of CDK/cyclin complexes. Plk1 regulates tyrosine dephosphorylation of CDKs through phosphorylation and activation of Cdc25C. CDK1 activation in turn leads to spindle formation and entry into M phase.\nAkt (PKB)\nAkt is involved in pathways that regulate cell growth by stimulating cell proliferation and suppressing apoptosis. Hsp90 inhibition by ansamycins results in a reduction in the Akt half life through ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Binding of cdc37 to Hsp90 is also required for the down-regulation of Akt. Following ansamycin treatment cancer cells arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle 24 hours after treatment and proceed to apoptosis 24-48 hours later. Normal cells also arrest 24 hours after ansamycin treatment, but do not proceed on to apoptosis.\nc-Raf, B-RAF, Mek\nThe RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK-MAP kinase pathway mediates cellular responses to growth signals. RAS is mutated to an oncogenic form in approximately 15% of human cancers. The three RAF genes are serine/threonine kinases that are regulated by binding RAS.\nEGFR\nThe epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is implicated in cell growth, differentiation, proliferation, survival, apoptosis, and migration. Overexpression of EGFR has been found in many different cancers and activating mutations of its kinase domain appear to be pathogenic in a subset of adenocarcinoams of the lung.\nFlt3\nFMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Flt3 activation also leads to the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and RAS signal-transduction cascades.\nc-Met\nc-met is a receptor tyrosine kinase which binds hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and regulates both cell motility and cell growth. c-met is overexpressed in tumours, including thyroid, stomach, pancreatic and colon cancer. HGF is also detected around the tumours, including liver metastases. This suggests that c-met and HGF play an important role in invasion and metastasis.\nCdk1, Cdk2, Cdk4, Cdk6\nCdk1, Cdk2, Cdk4, and Cdk6 drive the cell cycle. The activity of CDKs is regulated by their binding to specific subunits such as cyclins, inhibitory and assembly factors. The substrate specificity and timing of CDK activities is dictated by their interaction with specific cyclins. Cdk4/cyclin D and Cdk6/cyclin D are active in the G1 phase, Cdk2/cyclin E and Cdk2/cyclin A in S phase, and Cdc2/cyclin A and Cdc2/cyclin B in G2/M phase.\nCyclin-dependent kinase type 4 (CDK4), plays a key role in allowing cells to traverse G1 to S-phase transition of the cell cycle and is constitutively activated in many human cancers. The CDK4 activator, cyclin D1, is overexpressed and a CDK4 inhibitor, p16, is deleted in a variety of human tumours.\nCdk1/Cdk2 inhibitors have been developed which reversibly block normal cells in either the G1/S-phase or at the G2/M border. G2/M arrest is generally less well tolerated by the cells and consequently, they undergo apoptotic cell death. Since Hsp90 also is known to affect cell survival pathways this effect may be further amplified with an Hsp90 inhibitor.\nWee-1\nThe Wee-1 protein kinase carries out the inhibitory phosphorylation of CDC2 on tyrosine 15 (Tyr15). This is required for activation of the G2-phase checkpoint in response to DNA damage.\nHsp90 transcription factors implicated in cell proliferation and survival include the following:\nMutant p53\nP53 is a tumour suppressor protein that causes cell cycle arrest and induces apoptosis. P53 is mutated in approximately half of all cancers. Mutant p53 associates with Hsp90 and is down-regulated in cancer lines treated with Hsp90 inhibitors, while wild type p53 levels were unaffected.\nProgesterone Receptor/Estrogen Receptor/Androgen Receptor\nApproximately 70% of post-menopausal women who develop breast cancer have tumours that express the estrogen receptor. The first line treatment of these patients is directed at preventing signalling through this pathway and thus inhibiting tumour growth. This can be done by ovarian ablation, treatment with gonadotrophin releasing hormone agonists, aromatase inhibition or treatment with specific agonists which bind to the estrogen receptor but prevent further signalling. Ultimately patients develop resistance to these interventions often as a consequence of crosstalk between the estrogen receptor and growth factor receptors located on the cell membrane. In the unliganded state estrogen receptors are complexed with Hsp90 which facilitates hormone binding. Following binding to the mature receptor Hsp90 complex the liganded receptor can bind to hormone-response elements (HREs) within the regulatory regions of target genes involved in maintaining cell proliferation. Inhibition of Hsp90 initiates proteosomal degradation of the estrogen receptor thus preventing further growth signalling via this pathway. Prostate cancers are hormone-dependent malignancies that respond to therapeutic interventions which reduce circulating levels of testosterone or prevent testosterone binding to the androgen receptor. Although patients initially respond to these treatments most subsequently develop resistance via restoration of signalling via the androgen receptor. Prior to ligand binding the androgen receptor exists in a complex with Hsp90 and other co-chaperones including p23 and immunophilins. This interaction maintains the androgen receptor in a high-affinity ligand binding conformation. Inhibition of Hsp90 leads to proteosomal degradation of the androgen receptor and other co-chaperones which may sensitise the tumour to further hormonal therapies.\nMutated steroid hormone receptors that have arisen for example during anti-hormone therapy and which might be resistant to such therapies are likely to have a greater dependence on HSP90 for their stability and hormone binding function.\nHif-1a\nHypoxia inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor that controls the expression of genes which play a role in angiogenesis. HIF-1a is expressed in the majority of metastases and is known to associate with Hsp90. Ansamycin treatment of renal carcinoma cell lines leads to the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of HIF-1a.\nHsp90 inhibitors are capable of affecting a large number of targets significant to signal transduction in tumour cell proliferation. Signal transduction inhibitors which regulate the activities of a single target, may not be as efficacious due to signalling pathway redundancy and the rapid development of resistance.\nBy regulating multiple targets involved in cell signalling and cell proliferation HSP90 inhibitors may prove beneficial in the treatment of a wide spectrum of proliferative disorders.\nZAP70\nZAP-70, a member of the Syk-ZAP-70 protein tyrosine kinase family, is normally expressed in T cells and natural killer cells and has a critical role in the initiation of T-cell signalling. However, it is also expressed aberrantly in approximately 50% of cases of CLL, usually in those cases with unmutated B-cell receptor genes. The mutational status of immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable-region (IgVH) genes in the leukemic cells of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an important prognostic factor. The expression of ZAP-70 in CLL cells correlates with IgVH mutational status, disease progression, and survival. ZAP-70 positive CLL is more aggressive than ZAP-70 negative CLL indicating that ZAP-70 may be a key driver of malignancy in this disease. ZAP-70 is physically associated with HSP90 in B-CLL lymphoblasts thus the inhibition of Hsp90 may sensitise these cells to existing chemotherapy or monoclonal antibody therapy.\nhERG\nIn the late 1990s a number of drugs, approved by the US FDA, had to be withdrawn from sale in the US when it was discovered they were implicated in deaths caused by heart malfunction. It was subsequently found that a side effect of these drugs was the development of arrhythmias caused by the blocking of hERG channels in heart cells. The hERG channel is one of a family of potassium ion channels the first member of which was identified in the late 1980s in a mutant Drosophila melanogaster fruitfly (see Jan, L. Y. and Jan, Y. N. (1990). A Superfamily of Ion Channels. Nature, 345(6277):672). The biophysical properties of the hERG potassium ion channel are described in Sanguinetti, M. C., Jiang, C., Curran, M. E., and Keating, M. T. (1995). A Mechanistic Link Between an Inherited and an Acquired Cardiac Arrhythmia: HERG encodes the Ikr potassium channel. Cell, 81:299-307, and Trudeau, M. C., Warmke, J. W., Ganetzky, B., and Robertson, G. A. (1995). HERG, a Human Inward Rectifier in the Voltage-Gated Potassium Channel Family. Science, 269:92-95.\nThe elimination of hERG blocking activity remains an important consideration in the development of any new drug.\nHeat Shock Proteins and Antitumour Drug Resistance\nIt has long been recognized that the native tertiary conformation of any given polypeptide is determined by its primary (amino acid) sequence. However, as explained above, it is now clear that the proper folding of many proteins in vivo requires the assistance of heat-shock proteins (Hsps) acting as molecular chaperones. While this chaperone function is important to normal cellular function under all conditions, it becomes crucial in cells which are stressed (for example by heat, hypoxia or acidosis).\nSuch conditions typically prevail in tumour cells, which exist in a hostile host environment. The upregulation of Hsps often seen in such cells is therefore likely to represent a mechanism by which malignant cells maintain the integrity of their proteomes under conditions which compromise protein folding. Thus, modulators or inhibitors of stress proteins in general (and Hsp90 in particular) represent a class of chemotherapeutics with the unique ability to inhibit multiple aberrant signaling pathways simultaneously. They can therefore exert antitumour effects whilst eliminating (or reducing the incidence of) resistance relative to other treatment paradigms.\nMoreover, therapeutic anticancer interventions of all types necessarily increase the stresses imposed on the target tumour cells. In mitigating the deleterious effects of such stresses, Hsps are directly implicated in resisting the effects of cancer drugs and treatment regimens. Thus, modulators or inhibitors of stress protein function in general (and Hsp90 in particular) represent a class of chemotherapeutics with the potential for: (i) sensitizing malignant cells to anticancer drugs and/or treatments; (ii) alleviating or reducing the incidence of resistance to anticancer drugs and/or treatments; (iii) reversing resistance to anticancer drugs and/or treatments; (iv) potentiating the activity of anticancer drugs and/or treatments; (v) delaying or preventing the onset of resistance to anticancer drugs and/or treatments.\nHSP90 Inhibitors and the Treatment of Hepatitis C and Other Viral Diseases\nInfection of a host cell with viral RNA/DNA results in a substantial redirection of cellular protein synthesis towards key viral proteins encoded by the viral nucleic acid. The increased protein synthetic burden places a stress on the cell as a consequence of increased demand for energy and synthetic precursers. Upregulation of heat shock proteins is frequently a consequence of viral infection at least in part due to this stress. One function of the HSP induction may be to assist in the stabilization and folding of the high levels of \u2018foreign\u2019 protein generated in preparation for virus replication. In particular recent work has suggested that HSP90 is required for stable production of functional NS2/3 protease in Hepatitis C(HCV) replicon infected cells. HSP 90 inhibitors have also been demonstrated to block viral replication in in vitro systems. (Nagkagawa, S, Umehara T, Matsuda C, et al Biochem. Biophys. Res Commun. 353 (2007) 882-888; Waxman L, Witney, M et al PNAS 98 (2001) 13931-13935).\nAncillary Compounds\nA wide variety of ancillary compounds find application in the combinations of the invention, as described in detail below.

Thus, modulation encompasses physiological changes which effect an increase or decrease in the relevant heat shock protein activity. In the latter case, the modulation may be described as \u201cinhibition\u201d. The modulation may arise directly or indirectly, and may be mediated by any mechanism and at any physiological level, including for example at the level of gene expression (including for example transcription, translation and/or post-translational modification), at the level of expression of genes encoding regulatory elements which act directly or indirectly on the levels of heat shock protein activity. Thus, modulation may imply elevated/suppressed expression or over- or under-expression of the heat shock protein, including gene amplification (i.e. multiple gene copies) and/or increased or decreased expression by a transcriptional effect, as well as hyper- (or hypo-)activity and (de)activation of the heat shock protein (including (de)activation) by mutation(s). The terms \u201cmodulated\u201d, \u201cmodulating\u201d and \u201cmodulate\u201d are to be interpreted accordingly.\nAs used herein, the term \u201cmediated\u201d, as used e.g. in conjunction with the heat shock protein as described herein (and applied for example to various physiological processes, diseases, states, conditions, therapies, treatments or interventions) is intended to operate limitatively so that the various processes, diseases, states, conditions, treatments and interventions to which the term is applied are those in which heat shock protein Hsp90 plays a biological role. In cases where the term is applied to a disease, state or condition, the biological role played by heat shock protein Hsp90 may be direct or indirect and may be necessary and/or sufficient for the manifestation of the symptoms of the disease, state or condition (or its aetiology or progression). Thus, heat shock protein Hsp90 activity (and in particular aberrant levels of heat shock protein Hsp90 activity, e.g. Hsp90 over-expression) need not necessarily be the proximal cause of the disease, state or condition: rather, it is contemplated that the heat shock protein Hsp90 mediated diseases, states or conditions include those having multifactorial aetiologies and complex progressions in which Hsp90 is only partially involved. In cases where the term is applied to treatment, prophylaxis or intervention (e.g. in the \u201cHsp90-mediated treatments\u201d and \u201cHsp90-mediated prophylaxis\u201d of the invention), the role played by Hsp90 may be direct or indirect and may be necessary and/or sufficient for the operation of the treatment, prophylaxis or outcome of the intervention. Thus, a disease state or condition mediated by Hsp90 includes the development of resistance to any particular cancer drug or treatment (including in particular resistance to one or more of the ancillary compounds described herein).\nThe term \u201cintervention\u201d is a term of art used herein to define any agency which effects a physiological change at any level. Thus, the intervention may comprises the induction or repression of any physiological process, event, biochemical pathway or cellular/biochemical event. The interventions of the invention typically effect (or contribute to) the therapy, treatment or prophylaxis of a disease or condition.\nThe combinations of the invention may produce a therapeutically efficacious effect relative to the therapeutic effect of the individual compounds when administered separately.\nThe term \u2018efficacious\u2019 includes advantageous effects such as additivity, synergism, reduced side effects, reduced toxicity, increased time to disease progression, increased time of survival, sensitization or resensitization of one agent to another, or improved response rate.\nAdvantageously, an efficacious effect may allow for lower doses of each or either component to be administered to a patient, thereby decreasing the toxicity of chemotherapy, whilst producing and/or maintaining the same therapeutic effect.\nA \u201csynergistic\u201d effect in the present context refers to a therapeutic effect produced by the combination which is larger than the sum of the therapeutic effects of the components of the combination when presented individually.\nAn \u201cadditive\u201d effect in the present context refers to a therapeutic effect produced by the combination which is larger than the therapeutic effect of any of the components of the combination when presented individually.\nThe term \u201cresponse rate\u201d as used herein refers, in the case of a solid tumour, to the extent of reduction in the size of the tumour at a given time point, for example 12 weeks. Thus, for example, a 50% response rate means a reduction in tumour size of 50%. References herein to a \u201cclinical response\u201d refer to response rates of 50% or greater. A \u201cpartial response\u201d is defined herein as being a response rate of less than 50%.\nAs used herein, the term \u201ccombination\u201d, as applied to two or more compounds and/or agents (also referred to herein as the components), is intended tomay define material in which the two or more compounds/agents are associated. The terms \u201ccombined\u201d and \u201ccombining\u201d in this context are to be interpreted accordingly.\nThe association of the two or more compounds/agents in a combination may be physical or non-physical. Examples of physically associated combined compounds/agents include:\n    compositions (e.g. unitary formulations) comprising the two or more compounds/agents in admixture (for example within the same unit dose); compositions comprising material in which the two or more compounds/agents are chemically/physicochemically linked (for example by crosslinking, molecular agglomeration or binding to a common vehicle moiety); compositions comprising material in which the two or more compounds/agents are chemically/physicochemically co-packaged (for example, disposed on or within lipid vesicles, particles (e.g. micro- or nanoparticles) or emulsion droplets); pharmaceutical kits, pharmaceutical packs or patient packs in which the two or more compounds/agents are co-packaged or co-presented (e.g. as part of an array of unit doses);   \nExamples of non-physically associated combined compounds/agents include:\n    material (e.g. a non-unitary formulation) comprising at least one of the two or more compounds/agents together with instructions for the extemporaneous association of the at least one compound to form a physical association of the two or more compounds/agents; material (e.g. a non-unitary formulation) comprising at least one of the two or more compounds/agents together with instructions for combination therapy with the two or more compounds/agents; material comprising at least one of the two or more compounds/agents together with instructions for administration to a patient population in which the other(s) of the two or more compounds/agents have been (or are being) administered; material comprising at least one of the two or more compounds/agents in an amount or in a form which is specifically adapted for use in combination with the other(s) of the two or more compounds/agents.   \nAs used herein, the term \u201ccombination therapy\u201d is intended to define therapies which comprise the use of a combination of two or more compounds/agents (as defined above). Thus, references to \u201ccombination therapy\u201d, \u201ccombinations\u201d and the use of compounds/agents \u201cin combination\u201d in this application may refer to compounds/agents that are administered as part of the same overall treatment regimen. As such, the posology of each of the two or more compounds/agents may differ: each may be administered at the same time or at different times. It will therefore be appreciated that the compounds/agents of the combination may be administered sequentially (e.g. before or after) or simultaneously, either in the same pharmaceutical formulation (i.e. together), or in different pharmaceutical formulations (i.e. separately). Simultaneously in the same formulation is as a unitary formulation whereas simultaneously in different pharmaceutical formulations is non-unitary. The posologies of each of the two or more compounds/agents in a combination therapy may also differ with respect to the route of administration.\nAs used herein, the term \u201cpharmaceutical kit\u201d defines an array of one or more unit doses of a pharmaceutical composition together with dosing means (e.g. measuring device) and/or delivery means (e.g. inhaler or syringe), optionally all contained within common outer packaging. In pharmaceutical kits comprising a combination of two or more compounds/agents, the individual compounds/agents may unitary or non-unitary formulations. The unit dose(s) may be contained within a blister pack. The pharmaceutical kit may optionally further comprise instructions for use.\nAs used herein, the term \u201cpharmaceutical pack\u201d defines an array of one or more unit doses of a pharmaceutical composition, optionally contained within common outer packaging. In pharmaceutical packs comprising a combination of two or more compounds/agents, the individual compounds/agents may unitary or non-unitary formulations. The unit dose(s) may be contained within a blister pack. The pharmaceutical pack may optionally further comprise instructions for use.\nAs used herein, the term \u201cpatient pack\u201d defines a package, prescribed to a patient, which contains pharmaceutical compositions for the whole course of treatment. Patient packs usually contain one or more blister pack(s). Patient packs have an advantage over traditional prescriptions, where a pharmacist divides a patient's supply of a pharmaceutical from a bulk supply, in that the patient always has access to the package insert contained in the patient pack, normally missing in patient prescriptions. The inclusion of a package insert has been shown to improve patient compliance with the physician's instructions.\nThe combinations of the invention may produce a therapeutically efficacious effect relative to the therapeutic effect of the individual compounds/agents when administered separately.\nThe term \u201cancillary compound\u201d as used herein may define a compound which yields an efficacious combination (as herein defined) when combined with a compound of the formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VIa), (VII), (VIIa) or (VIIb) or any sub-groups or examples thereof as defined herein (including acid addition salts, particularly the L-lactate, and crystalline forms thereof). The ancillary compound may therefore act as an adjunct to the compound of the formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VIa), (VII), (VIIa) or (VIIb) or any sub-groups or examples thereof as defined herein (including acid addition salts, particularly the L-lactate, and crystalline forms thereof), or may otherwise contribute to the efficacy of the combination (for example, by producing a synergistic or additive effect or improving the response rate, as herein defined).\nIn this section, as in all other sections of this application, unless the context indicates otherwise, references to a compound of formula (I) includes all subgroups of formula (I) as defined herein, including formulae (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VIa), (VII), (VIIa) and (VIIb) (and in particular formula (VI)) (including acid addition salts, particularly the L-lactate, and crystalline forms thereof) and the term \u2018subgroups\u2019 includes all preferences, embodiments, examples and particular compounds defined herein.\nMoreover, a reference to a particular compound (including inter alia any of the compounds of formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VIa), (VII), (VIIa) or (VIIb) (and in particular formula (VI)) or any sub-groups or examples thereof as defined herein or to the ancillary compounds described herein, including acid addition salts, particularly the L-lactate, and crystalline forms thereof) includes ionic forms, salts, solvates, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, esters, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof, as discussed below: \u2014preferably, the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof: \u2014and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof.\nThe following general preferences and definitions shall apply to each of R1 to R8, R10, Ra, Rb, Rc, X1 and X2 and their various sub-groups, sub-definitions, examples and embodiments unless the context indicates otherwise.\nAny references to formula (I) herein shall also be taken to refer to and any sub-group of compounds within formula (I) and any preferences and examples thereof unless the context requires otherwise.\nReferences to \u201ccarbocyclic\u201d and \u201cheterocyclic\u201d groups as used herein shall, unless the context indicates otherwise, include both aromatic and non-aromatic ring systems. Thus, for example, the term \u201ccarbocyclic and heterocyclic groups\u201d includes within its scope aromatic, non-aromatic, unsaturated, partially saturated and fully saturated carbocyclic and heterocyclic ring systems. In general, such groups may be monocyclic or bicyclic and may contain, for example, 3 to 12 ring members, more usually 5 to 10 ring members. Examples of monocyclic groups are groups containing 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 ring members, more usually 3 to 7, for example 5 to 7, and preferably 5 or 6 ring members. Examples of bicyclic groups are those containing 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 ring members, and more usually 9 or 10 ring members.\nThe term \u201cbicyclic\u201d as used herein refers to groups that have two rings joined together in such as way that at least one ring member is shared by both rings. Thus, the bicyclic group can be a fused ring (two ring members shared by both rings), spirocyclic (one ring member shared by both rings) or a bridged ring (three or more ring members shared by both rings).\nThe carbocyclic or heterocyclic groups can be aryl or heteroaryl groups having from 5 to 12 ring members, more usually from 5 to 10 ring members. The term \u201caryl\u201d as used herein refers to a carbocyclic group having aromatic character and the term \u201cheteroaryl\u201d is used herein to denote a heterocyclic group having aromatic character. The terms \u201caryl\u201d and \u201cheteroaryl\u201d embrace polycyclic (e.g. bicyclic) ring systems wherein one or more rings are non-aromatic, provided that at least one ring is aromatic. In such polycyclic systems, the group may be attached by the aromatic ring, or by a non-aromatic ring. The aryl or heteroaryl groups can be monocyclic or bicyclic groups and can be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more substituents, for example one or more groups R10 as defined herein.\nThe term \u201cnon-aromatic group\u201d embraces unsaturated ring systems without aromatic character, partially saturated and fully saturated carbocyclic and heterocyclic ring systems. The terms \u201cunsaturated\u201d and \u201cpartially saturated\u201d refer to rings wherein the ring structure(s) contains atoms sharing more than one valence bond i.e. the ring contains at least one multiple bond e.g. a C\u2550C, C\u2261C or N\u2550C bond. The terms \u201cfully saturated\u201d and \u201csaturated\u201d refer to rings where there are no multiple bonds between ring atoms. Saturated carbocyclic groups include cycloalkyl groups as defined below. Partially saturated carbocyclic groups include cycloalkenyl groups as defined below, for example cyclopentenyl, cycloheptenyl and cyclooctenyl. A further example of a cycloalkenyl group is cyclohexenyl.\nExamples of heteroaryl groups are monocyclic and bicyclic groups containing from five to twelve ring members, and more usually from five to ten ring members. The heteroaryl group can be, for example, a five membered or six membered monocyclic ring or a bicyclic structure formed from fused five and six membered rings or two fused six membered rings or, by way of a further example, two fused five membered rings. Each ring may contain up to about four heteroatoms typically selected from nitrogen, sulphur and oxygen. Typically the heteroaryl ring will contain up to 4 heteroatoms, more typically up to 3 heteroatoms, more usually up to 2, for example a single heteroatom. In one embodiment, the heteroaryl ring contains at least one ring nitrogen atom. The nitrogen atoms in the heteroaryl rings can be basic, as in the case of an imidazole or pyridine, or essentially non-basic as in the case of an indole or pyrrole nitrogen. In general the number of basic nitrogen atoms present in the heteroaryl group, including any amino group substituents of the ring, will be less than five.\nExamples of five membered heteroaryl groups include but are not limited to pyrrole, furan, thiophene, imidazole, furazan, oxazole, oxadiazole, oxatriazole, isoxazole, thiazole, isothiazole, pyrazole, triazole and tetrazole groups.\nExamples of six membered heteroaryl groups include but are not limited to pyridine, pyrazine, pyridazine, pyrimidine and triazine.\nA bicyclic heteroaryl group may be, for example, a group selected from:\na) a benzene ring fused to a 5- or 6-membered ring containing 1, 2 or 3 ring heteroatoms;\nb) a pyridine ring fused to a 5- or 6-membered ring containing 1, 2 or 3 ring heteroatoms;\nc) a pyrimidine ring fused to a 5- or 6-membered ring containing 1 or 2 ring heteroatoms;\nd) a pyrrole ring fused to a 5- or 6-membered ring containing 1, 2 or 3 ring heteroatoms;\ne) a pyrazole ring fused to a 5- or 6-membered ring containing 1 or 2 ring heteroatoms;\nf) a pyrazine ring fused to a 5- or 6-membered ring containing 1 or 2 ring heteroatoms;\ng) an imidazole ring fused to a 5- or 6-membered ring containing 1 or 2 ring heteroatoms;\nh) an oxazole ring fused to a 5- or 6-membered ring containing 1 or 2 ring heteroatoms;\ni) an isoxazole ring fused to a 5- or 6-membered ring containing 1 or 2 ring heteroatoms;\nj) a thiazole ring fused to a 5- or 6-membered ring containing 1 or 2 ring heteroatoms;\nk) an isothiazole ring fused to a 5- or 6-membered ring containing 1 or 2 ring heteroatoms;\nl) a thiophene ring fused to a 5- or 6-membered ring containing 1, 2 or 3 ring heteroatoms;\nm) a furan ring fused to a 5- or 6-membered ring containing 1, 2 or 3 ring heteroatoms;\nn) a cyclohexyl ring fused to a 5- or 6-membered ring containing 1, 2 or 3 ring heteroatoms; and\no) a cyclopentyl ring fused to a 5- or 6-membered ring containing 1, 2 or 3 ring heteroatoms.\nOne sub-group of bicyclic heteroaryl groups consists of groups (a) to (e) and (g) to (o) above.\nParticular examples of bicyclic heteroaryl groups containing a five membered ring fused to another five membered ring include but are not limited to imidazothiazole (e.g. imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole) and imidazoimidazole (e.g. imidazo[1,2-a]imidazole).\nParticular examples of bicyclic heteroaryl groups containing a six membered ring fused to a five membered ring include but are not limited to benzfuran, benzthiophene, benzimidazole, benzoxazole, isobenzoxazole, benzisoxazole, benzthiazole, benzisothiazole, isobenzofuran, indole, isoindole, indolizine, indoline, isoindoline, purine (e.g., adenine, guanine), indazole, pyrazolopyrimidine (e.g. pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine), triazolopyrimidine (e.g. [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine), benzodioxole and pyrazolopyridine (e.g. pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine) groups.\nParticular examples of bicyclic heteroaryl groups containing two fused six membered rings include but are not limited to quinoline, isoquinoline, chroman, thiochroman, chromene, isochromene, chroman, isochroman, benzodioxan, quinolizine, benzoxazine, benzodiazine, pyridopyridine, quinoxaline, quinazoline, cinnoline, phthalazine, naphthyridine and pteridine groups.\nOne sub-group of heteroaryl groups comprises pyridyl, pyrrolyl, furanyl, thienyl, imidazolyl, oxazolyl, oxadiazolyl, oxatriazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, pyrazolyl, pyrazinyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl, triazinyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, benzfuranyl, benzthienyl, chromanyl, thiochromanyl, benzimidazolyl, benzoxazolyl, benzisoxazole, benzthiazolyl and benzisothiazole, isobenzofuranyl, indolyl, isoindolyl, indolizinyl, indolinyl, isoindolinyl, purinyl (e.g., adenine, guanine), indazolyl, benzodioxolyl, chromenyl, isochromenyl, isochromanyl, benzodioxanyl, quinolizinyl, benzoxazinyl, benzodiazinyl, pyridopyridinyl, quinoxalinyl, quinazolinyl, cinnolinyl, phthalazinyl, naphthyridinyl and pteridinyl groups.\nExamples of polycyclic aryl and heteroaryl groups containing an aromatic ring and a non-aromatic ring include tetrahydronaphthalene, tetrahydroisoquinoline, tetrahydroquinoline, dihydrobenzthiene, dihydrobenzfuran, 2,3-dihydro-benzo[1,4]dioxine, benzo[1,3]dioxole, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzofuran, indoline and indane groups.\nExamples of carbocyclic aryl groups include phenyl, naphthyl, indenyl, and tetrahydronaphthyl groups.\nExamples of non-aromatic heterocyclic groups include unsubstituted or substituted (by one or more groups R10) heterocyclic groups having from 3 to 12 ring members, typically 4 to 12 ring members, and more usually from 5 to 10 ring members. Such groups can be monocyclic or bicyclic, for example, and typically have from 1 to 5 heteroatom ring members (more usually 1, 2, 3 or 4 heteroatom ring members) typically selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur.\nWhen sulphur is present, it may, where the nature of the adjacent atoms and groups permits, exist as \u2014S\u2014, \u2014S(O)\u2014 or \u2014S(O)2\u2014.\nThe heterocylic groups can contain, for example, cyclic ether moieties (e.g. as in tetrahydrofuran and dioxane), cyclic thioether moieties (e.g. as in tetrahydrothiophene and dithiane), cyclic amine moieties (e.g. as in pyrrolidine), cyclic amide moieties (e.g. as in pyrrolidone), cyclic thioamides, cyclic thioesters, cyclic ester moieties (e.g. as in butyrolactone), cyclic sulphones (e.g. as in sulpholane and sulpholene), cyclic sulphoxides, cyclic sulphonamides and combinations thereof (e.g. morpholine and thiomorpholine and its S-oxide and S,S-dioxide).

Examples of such cycloalkyl groups include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and cycloheptyl; more typically cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl, particularly cyclohexyl.\nFurther examples of non-aromatic cyclic groups include bridged ring systems such as bicycloalkanes and azabicycloalkanes although such bridged ring systems are generally less preferred. By \u201cbridged ring systems\u201d is meant ring systems in which two rings share more than two atoms, see for example Advanced Organic Chemistry, by Jerry March, 4th Edition, Wiley Interscience, pages 131-133, 1992. Examples of bridged ring systems include bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, aza-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, aza-bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, bicyclo[3.2.1]octane and aza-bicyclo[3.2.1]octane. A particular example of a bridged ring system is the 1-aza-bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-yl group.\nWhere reference is made herein to carbocyclic and heterocyclic groups, the carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring can, unless the context indicates otherwise, be unsubstituted or substituted by one or more substituent groups R10 selected from halogen, hydroxy, trifluoromethyl, cyano, nitro, carboxy, amino, mono- or di-C1-4 hydrocarbylamino, carbocyclic and heterocyclic groups having from 3 to 12 ring members; a group Ra\u2014Rb wherein Ra is a bond, O, CO, X1C(X2), C(X2)X1, X1C(X2)X1, S, SO, SO2, NRc, SO2NRc or NRcSO2; and Rb is selected from hydrogen, carbocyclic and heterocyclic groups having from 3 to 12 ring members, and a C1-12 hydrocarbyl group (such as a C1-10 hydrocarbyl group) optionally substituted by one or more substituents selected from hydroxy, oxo, halogen, cyano, nitro, carboxy, amino, mono- or di-C1-8 non-aromatic hydrocarbylamino (e.g. mono- or di-C1-4 hydrocarbylamino), carbocyclic and heterocyclic groups having from 3 to 12 ring members and wherein one or more carbon atoms of the C1-12 hydrocarbyl group (or C1-10 hydrocarbyl group) may optionally be replaced by O, S, SO, SO2, NRc, X1C(X2), C(X2)X1 or X1C(X2)X1;\n    Rc is selected from Rb, hydrogen and C1-4 hydrocarbyl; and X1 is O, S or NRc and X2 is \u2550O, \u2550S or \u2550NRc.   \nWhere the substituent group R10 comprises or includes a carbocyclic or heterocyclic group, the said carbocyclic or heterocyclic group may be unsubstituted or may itself be substituted with one or more further substituent groups R10. In one sub-group of compounds of the formula (I), such further substituent groups R10 may include carbocyclic or heterocyclic groups, which are typically not themselves further substituted. In another sub-group of compounds of the formula (I), the said further substituents do not include carbocyclic or heterocyclic groups but are otherwise selected from the groups listed above in the definition of R10.\nThe substituents R10 may be selected such that they contain no more than 20 non-hydrogen atoms, for example, no more than 15 non-hydrogen atoms, e.g. no more than 12, or 11, or 10, or 9, or 8, or 7, or 6, or 5 non-hydrogen atoms.\nWhere the carbocyclic and heterocyclic groups have a pair of substituents on the same or adjacent ring atoms, the two substituents may be linked so as to form a cyclic group. Thus, two adjacent groups R10, together with the carbon atoms or heteroatoms to which they are attached may form a 5-membered heteroaryl ring or a 5- or 6-membered non-aromatic carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring, wherein the said heteroaryl and heterocyclic groups contain up to 3 heteroatom ring members selected from N, O and S. For example, an adjacent pair of substituents on adjacent carbon atoms of a ring may be linked via one or more heteroatoms and optionally substituted alkylene groups to form a fused oxa-, dioxa-, aza-, diaza- or oxa-aza-cycloalkyl group.\nExamples of such linked substituent groups include:\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nExamples of halogen substituents include fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine. Fluorine and chlorine are particularly preferred.\nIn the definition of the compounds of the formula (I) above and as used hereinafter, the term \u201chydrocarbyl\u201d is a generic term encompassing aliphatic, alicyclic and aromatic groups having an all-carbon backbone and consisting of carbon and hydrogen atoms, except where otherwise stated.\nIn certain cases, as defined herein, one or more of the carbon atoms making up the carbon backbone may be replaced by a specified atom or group of atoms.\nExamples of hydrocarbyl groups include alkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, carbocyclic aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkylalkyl, cycloalkenylalkyl, and carbocyclic aralkyl, aralkenyl and aralkynyl groups.

The examples and preferences expressed below apply to each of the hydrocarbyl substituent groups or hydrocarbyl-containing substituent groups referred to in the various definitions of substituents for compounds of the formula (I) unless the context indicates otherwise.\nThe prefix \u201cCx-y\u201d (where x and y are integers) as used herein refers to the number of carbon atoms in a given group. Thus, a C1-4 hydrocarbyl group contains from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and a C3-6 cycloalkyl group contains from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, and so on.\nThe term \u201cacyclic hydrocarbyl\u201d (e.g. as in \u201cacyclic C1-5 hydrocarbyl\u201d) as used herein refers to non-cyclic hydrocarbyl groups and in particular to alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl groups as defined herein.\nThe term \u201cmono- or di-C1-5 hydrocarbylamino\u201d as used herein refers to a monosubstituted or disubstituted amine group bearing either one or two hydrocarbyl substituent groups that each contain from 1 to 5 carbon atoms.\nPreferred non-aromatic hydrocarbyl groups are saturated groups such as alkyl and cycloalkyl groups.\nGenerally by way of example, the hydrocarbyl groups can have up to ten carbon atoms (and more typically up to eight carbon atoms), unless the context requires otherwise. Within the sub-set of hydrocarbyl groups having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, particular examples are C1-8 hydrocarbyl groups or C1-6 hydrocarbyl groups, such as C1-4 hydrocarbyl groups (e.g. C1-3 hydrocarbyl groups or C1-2 hydrocarbyl groups or C2-3 hydrocarbyl groups or C2-4 hydrocarbyl groups), specific examples being any individual value or combination of values selected from C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9 and C10 hydrocarbyl groups.\nThe term \u201calkyl\u201d covers both straight chain and branched chain alkyl groups.

Within this definition, particular C1-5 hydrocarbyl groups are saturated C1-5 hydrocarbyl groups, namely alkyl and cycloalkyl groups, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, 3-methylbutyl, 2-methyl butyl, pent-2-yl, pent-3-yl, 3-methylbut-2-yl, 2,2-dimethylpropyl, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclopropylmethyl, cyclopropylethyl, cyclobutylmethyl, methylcyclopropyl, ethylcyclopropyl, dimethylcyclopropyl, methylcyclobutyl.\nAlso within the scope of the term C1-5 hydrocarbyl as used herein are unsaturated C1-5 hydrocarbyl groups, i.e. alkene, cycloalkene and alkyne groups such as vinyl, 1-propenyl, isopropenyl, 1-butenyl, 2-butenyl, 1-pentenyl, 2-pentenyl, allyl, methylallyl, dimethylallyl, acetylenyl, propargyl, cyclobutenyl and cyclopentenyl.\nThe term C1-4 hydrocarbyl as used herein encompasses alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl and cycloalkenyl groups wherein the preferences for and examples of the aforesaid groups are as defined above. Within this definition, particular C1-4 hydrocarbyl groups are alkyl and cycloalkyl groups, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, cyclopropyl and cyclobutyl.\nWhen present, and where stated, a hydrocarbyl group can be optionally substituted by one or more substituents selected from hydroxy, oxo, alkoxy, carboxy, halogen, cyano, nitro, amino, mono- or di-C1-4 hydrocarbylamino, and monocyclic or bicyclic carbocyclic and heterocyclic groups having from 3 to 12 (typically 3 to 10 and more usually 5 to 10) ring members. Preferred substituents include halogen such as fluorine.

For example, 1, 2, 3 or 4 carbon atoms of the hydrocarbyl group may be replaced by one of the atoms or groups listed, and the replacing atoms or groups may be the same or different. In general, the number of linear or backbone carbon atoms replaced will correspond to the number of linear or backbone atoms in the group replacing them. Examples of groups in which one or more carbon atom of the hydrocarbyl group have been replaced by a replacement atom or group as defined above include ethers and thioethers (C replaced by O or S), amides, esters, thioamides and thioesters (C\u2014C replaced by X1C(X2) or C(X2)X1), sulphones and sulphoxides (C replaced by SO or SO2), amines (C replaced by NRc). Further examples include ureas, carbonates and carbamates (C\u2014C\u2014C replaced by X1C(X2)X1).\nWhere an amino group has two hydrocarbyl substituents, they may, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, and optionally with another heteroatom such as nitrogen, sulphur, or oxygen, link to form a ring structure of 4 to 7 ring members, more usually 5 to 6 ring members.\nThe term \u201caza-cycloalkyl\u201d as used herein refers to a cycloalkyl group in which one of the carbon ring members has been replaced by a nitrogen atom. Thus examples of aza-cycloalkyl groups include piperidine and pyrrolidine. The term \u201coxa-cycloalkyl\u201d as used herein refers to a cycloalkyl group in which one of the carbon ring members has been replaced by an oxygen atom. Thus examples of oxa-cycloalkyl groups include tetrahydrofuran and tetrahydropyran.

More usually, the molecular weight of the compound will be less than 750, for example less than 700, or less than 650, or less than 600, or less than 550. More preferably, the molecular weight is less than 525 and, for example, is 500 or less.\nOne preferred compound of the formula (I) is the compound of formula (I):\n              \nwhich has the chemical name (2,4-dihydroxy-5-isopropyl-phenyl)-[5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dihydro-isoindol-2-yl]-methanone.\n\nAcid Addition salts of 2,4-dihydroxy-5-isopropyl-phenyl)-[5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dihydro-isoindol-2-yl]-methanone\nThe 2,4-dihydroxy-5-isopropyl-phenyl)-[5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dihydro-isoindol-2-yl]-methanone may be presented in the form of an acid addition salt.\nAcid addition salts may be formed with a wide variety of acids, both inorganic and organic. Examples of acid addition salts include salts formed with an acid selected from the group consisting of acetic, 2,2-dichloroacetic, adipic, alginic, ascorbic (e.g. L-ascorbic), aspartic (e.g. L-aspartic), benzenesulphonic, benzoic, 4-acetamidobenzoic, butanoic, camphoric (e.g. (+) camphoric), camphor-sulphonic, (+)-(1S)-camphor-10-sulphonic, capric, caproic, caprylic, carbonic, cinnamic, citric, cyclamic, dodecanoic, dodecylsulphuric, ethane-1,2-disulphonic, ethanesulphonic, 2-hydroxyethanesulphonic, formic, fumaric, galactaric, gentisic, glucoheptonic, D-gluconic, glucuronic (e.g. D-glucuronic), glutamic (e.g. L-glutamic), \u03b1-oxoglutaric, glycolic, hippuric, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, hydriodic, isethionic, isobutyric, lactic (e.g. (+)-L-lactic [which may be referred to elsewhere herein simply as L-lactic acid] and (\u00b1)-DL-lactic), laurylsulphonic, lactobionic, maleic, malic, (\u2212)-L-malic, malonic, (\u00b1)-DL-mandelic, methanesulphonic, mucic, naphthalenesulphonic (e.g. naphthalene-2-sulphonic and naphthalene-1,5-disulphonic), 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic, nicotinic, nitric, oleic, orotic, oxalic, palmitic, pamoic, phosphoric, propionic, L-pyroglutamic, salicylic, 4-amino-salicylic, sebacic, stearic, succinic, sulphuric, tannic, tartaric (e.g. (+)-L-tartaric), thiocyanic, toluenesulphonic (e.g. p-toluenesulphonic), undecylenic, valeric acids and xinafoic acids.\nParticular acid addition salts are the salts formed with hydrochloric acid, lactic acid (e.g. L-lactic acid) or sulphuric acid.\nA preferred salt is the salt formed with lactic acid, i.e. the lactate salt and in particular the L-lactate salt.\nThe acid addition salts are typically pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are discussed in Berge et al., 1977, \u201cPharmaceutically Acceptable Salts,\u201d J. Pharm. Sci., Vol. 66, pp. 1-19.\nIn the solid state, the acid addition salts can be crystalline or amorphous or a mixture thereof.\nIn one embodiment, the salts are amorphous.\nIn an amorphous solid, the three dimensional structure that normally exists in a crystalline form does not exist and the positions of the molecules relative to one another in the amorphous form are essentially random, see for example Hancock et al. J. Pharm. Sci. (1997), 86, 1).\nIn another embodiment, the acid addition salts are substantially crystalline.\nThe acid addition salts can be synthesized from the parent compound by conventional chemical methods such as methods described in Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use, P. Heinrich Stahl (Editor), Camille G. Wermuth (Editor), ISBN: 3-90639-026-8, Hardcover, 388 pages, August 2002. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free base form of the compound of formula (1) with the appropriate acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two.\nFor example, the acid addition salt can be prepared by forming a solution of (2,4-dihydroxy-5-isopropyl-phenyl)-[5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dihydro-isoindol-2-yl]-methanone free base in a solvent (typically an organic solvent) or mixture of solvents, and treating the solution with an acid to form a precipitate of the acid addition salt.\nThe acid may be added as a solution in a solvent which is miscible with the solvent in which the free base is dissolved. The solvent in which the free base is initially dissolved may be one in which the acid addition salt thereof is insoluble. Alternatively, the solvent in which the free base is initially dissolved may be one in which the acid addition salt is at least partially soluble, a different solvent in which the acid addition salt is less soluble subsequently being added such that the salt precipitates out of solution.\nIn an alternative method of forming an acid addition salt, (2,4-dihydroxy-5-isopropyl-phenyl)-[5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dihydro-isoindol-2-yl]-methanone is dissolved in a solvent comprising a volatile acid and optionally a co-solvent, thereby to form a solution of the acid addition salt with the volatile acid, and the resulting solution is then concentrated or evaporated to isolate the salt. An example of an acid addition salt that can be made in this way is the acetate salt.\nThe salt is typically precipitated from the organic solvent as it is formed and hence can be isolated by separation of the solid from the solution, e.g. by filtration.\nOne acid salt can be converted to the free base and optionally to another acid addition salt by methods well known to the skilled person. For example, the free base can be formed by passing the salt solution through a column containing an amine stationary phase (e.g. a Strata-NH2 column). Alternatively, a solution of the acid addition salt in water can be treated with sodium bicarbonate to decompose the salt and precipitate out the free base. The free base may then be combined with another acid by one of the methods described above or elsewhere herein.\nAcid addition salts have a number of advantages over the corresponding free base. For example, they will enjoy one or more of the following advantages over the free base in that they:\n    will be more soluble and hence will be better for i.v. administration (e.g. by infusion) will have better stability (e.g. improved shelf life); will have better thermal stability; will be less basic and therefore better for i.v. administration; will have advantages for production; will have improved solubility in aqueous solution; will have better physicochemical properties; may have improved anti-cancer activity; and may have an improved therapeutic index.   \nParticular advantages of the L-lactate salt of the compound of formula (1) are that it:\n    is not hydrated and therefore is easier to formulate; has fewer polymorphic forms than the free base and other salt forms tested (i.e. the salts formed with hydrochloric acid and sulphuric acid); is non-hygroscopic; and\n\nhas a better rate of solubility than the free base and other salts tested.\n   \nThe term \u2018stable\u2019 or \u2018stability\u2019 as used herein includes chemical stability and solid state (physical) stability. The term \u2018chemical stability\u2019 means that the compound can be stored in an isolated form, or in the form of a formulation in which it is provided in admixture with for example, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or adjuvants as described herein, under normal storage conditions, with little or no chemical degradation or decomposition' for example for a period of six months or more, more usually twelve months or more, for example eighteen months or more. \u2018Solid-state stability\u2019 means the compound can be stored in an isolated solid form, or the form of a solid formulation in which it is provided in admixture with, for example, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or adjuvants as described herein, under normal storage conditions, with little or no solid-state transformation (e.g. hydration, dehydration, solvatisation, desolvatisation, crystallisation, recrystallisation or solid-state phase transition).\nThe terms \u201cnon-hygroscopic\u201d and \u201cnon-hygroscopicity\u201d and related terms as used herein refer to substances that absorb less than 5% by weight (relative to their own weight) of water when exposed to conditions of high relative humidity, for example 90% relative humidity, and/or do not undergo changes in crystalline form in conditions of high humidity and/or do not absorb water into the body of the crystal (internal water) in conditions of high relative humidity.\nCrystalline Forms of 2,4-dihydroxy-5-isopropyl-phenyl)-[5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dihydro-isoindol-2-yl]-methanone\nIn another preferred embodiment, the compound of formula (1) i.e. (2,4-dihydroxy-5-isopropyl-phenyl)-[5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dihydro-isoindol-2-yl]-methanone, or an acid addition salt thereof, is presented in substantially crystalline form.\nBy \u201csubstantially crystalline\u201d is meant that the compound of formula (1) or its acid addition salt are from 50% to 100% crystalline, and more particularly the compound of formula (1) or its acid addition salts may be at least 50% crystalline, or at least 60% crystalline, or at least 70% crystalline, or at least 80% crystalline, or at least 90% crystalline, or at least 95% crystalline, or at least 98% crystalline, or at least 99% crystalline, or at least 99.5% crystalline, or at least 99.9% crystalline, for example 100% crystalline.\nMore preferably the compound of formula (1) or its acid addition salts are those (or may be selected from the group consisting of those) that are 95% to 100% crystalline, for example at least 98% crystalline, or at least 99% crystalline, or at least 99.5% crystalline, or at least 99.6% crystalline or at least 99.7% crystalline or at least 99.8% crystalline or at least 99.9% crystalline, for example 100% crystalline.\nThe crystalline forms, in the solid state, can be solvated (e.g. hydrated) or non-solvated (e.g. anhydrous).\nIn one embodiment, the crystalline forms are non-solvated (e.g. anhydrous).\nThe term \u201canhydrous\u201d as used herein does not exclude the possibility of the presence of some water on or in the salt (e.g. a crystal of the salt). For example, there may be some water present on the surface of the salt (e.g. salt crystal), or minor amounts within the body of the salt (e.g. crystal). Typically, an anhydrous form contains fewer than 0.4 molecules of water per molecule of compound, and more preferably contains fewer than 0.1 molecules of water per molecule of compound, for example 0 molecules of water.\nIn another embodiment, the crystalline forms are solvated. Where the crystalline forms are hydrated, they can contain, for example, up to three molecules of water of crystallisation, more usually up to two molecules of water, e.g. one molecule of water or two molecules of water. Non-stoichiometric hydrates may also be formed in which the number of molecules of water present is less than one or is otherwise a non-integer. For example, where there is less than one molecule of water present, there may be for example 0.4, or 0.5, or 0.6, or 0.7, or 0.8, or 0.9 molecules of water present per molecule of compound.\nOther solvates include alcoholates such as ethanolates and isopropanolates.\nThe crystalline forms described herein, individual crystals thereof and their crystal structures form further aspects of the invention.\nThe crystalline forms and their crystal structures can be characterised using a number of techniques including single crystal X-ray crystallography, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and infra red spectroscopy, e.g. Fourier Transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR). The behaviour of the crystals under conditions of varying humidity can be analysed by gravimetric vapour sorption studies and also by XRPD.\nDetermination of the crystal structure of a compound can be performed by X-ray crystallography which can be carried out according to conventional methods, such as those described herein and in Fundamentals of Crystallography, C. Giacovazzo, H. L. Monaco, D. Viterbo, F. Scordari, G. Gilli, G. Zanotti and M. Catti, (International Union of Crystallography/Oxford University Press, 1992 ISBN 0-19-855578-4 (p/b), 0-19-85579-2 (h/b)). This technique involves the analysis and interpretation of the X-ray diffraction of single crystal.\nAlternatively, the crystalline structure of a compound can be analysed by the solid state technique of X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD). XRPD can be carried out according to conventional methods such as those described herein and in Introduction to X-ray Powder Diffraction, Ron Jenkins and Robert L. Snyder (John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1996). The presence of defined peaks (as opposed to random background noise) in an XRPD diffractogram indicates that the compound has a degree of crystallinity.\nA compound's X-ray powder pattern is characterised by the diffraction angle (2\u03b8) and interplanar spacing (d) parameters of an X-ray diffraction spectrum. These are related by Bragg's equation, n\u03bb=2d Sin \u03b8, (where n=1; \u03bb=wavelength of the cathode used; d=interplanar spacing; and \u03b8=diffraction angle). Herein, interplanar spacings, diffraction angle and overall pattern are important for identification of crystal in the X-ray powder diffraction, due to the characteristics of the data. The relative intensity should not be strictly interpreted since it may be varied depending on the direction of crystal growth, particle sizes and measurement conditions. In addition, the diffraction angles usually mean ones which coincide in the range of 2\u03b8\u00b10.2\u00b0. The peaks mean main peaks and include peaks not larger than medium at diffraction angles other than those stated above.\nThe compound of formula (1) and its acid addition salts exist in a number of different crystalline forms and these are described in more detail in our co-pending GB 0620259.2 and U.S. provisional patent application Ser.

Heinrich Stahl (Editor), Camille G. Wermuth (Editor), ISBN: 3-90639-026-8, Hardcover, 388 pages, August 2002.

Examples of acid addition salts include salts formed with an acid selected from the group consisting of acetic, 2,2-dichloroacetic, adipic, alginic, ascorbic (e.g. L-ascorbic), L-aspartic, benzenesulphonic, benzoic, 4-acetamidobenzoic, butanoic, (+) camphoric, camphor-sulphonic, (+)-(1S)-camphor-10-sulphonic, capric, caproic, caprylic, cinnamic, citric, cyclamic, dodecylsulphuric, ethane-1,2-disulphonic, ethanesulphonic, 2-hydroxyethanesulphonic, formic, fumaric, galactaric, gentisic, glucoheptonic, D-gluconic, glucuronic (e.g. D-glucuronic), glutamic (e.g. L-glutamic), \u03b1-oxoglutaric, glycolic, hippuric, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, hydriodic, isethionic, (+)-L-lactic, (\u00b1)-DL-lactic, lactobionic, maleic, malic, (\u2212)-L-malic, malonic, (\u00b1)-DL-mandelic, methanesulphonic, naphthalene-2-sulphonic, naphthalene-1,5-disulphonic, 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic, nicotinic, nitric, oleic, orotic, oxalic, palmitic, pamoic, phosphoric, propionic, L-pyroglutamic, salicylic, 4-amino-salicylic, sebacic, stearic, succinic, sulphuric, tannic, (+)-L-tartaric, thiocyanic, p-toluenesulphonic, undecylenic and valeric acids, as well as acylated amino acids and cation exchange resins.\nIf the compound is anionic, or has a functional group which may be anionic (e.g., \u2014COOH may be \u2014COO\u2212), then a salt may be formed with a suitable cation. Examples of suitable inorganic cations include, but are not limited to, alkali metal ions such as Na+ and K+, alkaline earth metal cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2+, and other cations such as Al3+. Examples of suitable organic cations include, but are not limited to, ammonium ion (i.e., NH4 +) and substituted ammonium ions (e.g., NH3R+, NH2R2 +, NHR3 +, NR4 +). Examples of some suitable substituted ammonium ions are those derived from: ethylamine, diethylamine, dicyclohexylamine, triethylamine, butylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperazine, benzylamine, phenylbenzylamine, choline, meglumine, and tromethamine, as well as amino acids, such as lysine and arginine. An example of a common quaternary ammonium ion is N(CH3)4 +.\nWhere the compounds contain an amine function, these may form quaternary ammonium salts, for example by reaction with an alkylating agent according to methods well known to the skilled person. Such quaternary ammonium compounds are within the scope of formula (I).\nThe salt forms of the compounds are typically pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are discussed in Berge et al., 1977, \u201cPharmaceutically Acceptable Salts,\u201d J. Pharm. Sci., Vol. 66, pp. 1-19. However, salts that are not pharmaceutically acceptable may also be prepared as intermediate forms which may then be converted into pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Such non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts forms, which may be useful, for example, in the purification or separation of the compounds, also form part of the invention.\nCompounds (e.g. of the formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VIa), (VII), (VIIa) or (VIIb) or any sub-groups or examples thereof as defined herein) containing an amine function may also form N-oxides. A reference herein to such a compound that contains an amine function also includes the N-oxide.\nWhere a compound contains several amine functions, one or more than one nitrogen atom may be oxidised to form an N-oxide. Particular examples of N-oxides are the N-oxides of a tertiary amine or a nitrogen atom of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle.\nN-Oxides can be formed by treatment of the corresponding amine with an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide or a per-acid (e.g. a peroxycarboxylic acid), see for example Advanced Organic Chemistry, by Jerry March, 4th Edition, Wiley Interscience, pages. More particularly, N-oxides can be made by the procedure of L. W. Deady (Syn. Comm. 1977, 7, 509-514) in which the amine compound is reacted with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (MCPBA), for example, in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane.\nCompounds comprised in the combinations of the invention (e.g. compounds of the formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VIa), (VII), (VIIa) or (VIIb) or any sub-groups or examples thereof as defined herein, including acid addition salts, particularly the L-lactate, and crystalline forms thereof) may exist in a number of different geometric isomeric, and tautomeric forms and references to such compounds include all such forms. For the avoidance of doubt, where a compound can exist in one of several geometric isomeric or tautomeric forms and only one is specifically described or shown, all others are nevertheless contemplated (and are for example embraced by formula (I)).\nExamples of tautomeric forms include, for example, keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms, as in, for example, the following tautomeric pairs: keto/enol (illustrated below), imine/enamine, amide/imino alcohol, amidine/amidine, nitroso/oxime, thioketone/enethiol, and nitro/aci-nitro.\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nWhere any constituent compound of the combination of the invention (e.g. compounds of the formula (I)) contain one or more chiral centres, and can exist in the form of two or more optical isomers, references to such compounds include all optical isomeric forms thereof (e.g. enantiomers, epimers and diastereoisomers), either as individual optical isomers, or mixtures (e.g. racemic mixtures) or two or more optical isomers, unless the context requires otherwise.\nThe optical isomers may be characterised and identified by their optical activity (i.e. as + and \u2212 isomers, or d and l isomers) or they may be characterised in terms of their absolute stereochemistry using the \u201cR and S\u201d nomenclature developed by Cahn, Ingold and Prelog, see Advanced Organic Chemistry by Jerry March, 4th Edition, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1992, pages 109-114, and see also Cahn, Ingold & Prelog, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 1966, 5, 385-415.\nOptical isomers can be separated by a number of techniques including chiral chromatography (chromatography on a chiral support) and such techniques are well known to the person skilled in the art.\nAs an alternative to chiral chromatography, optical isomers can be separated by forming diastereoisomeric salts with chiral acids such as (+)-tartaric acid, (\u2212)-pyroglutamic acid, (\u2212)-di-toluoyl-L-tartaric acid, (+)-mandelic acid, (\u2212)-malic acid, and (\u2212)-camphorsulphonic, separating the diastereoisomers by preferential crystallisation, and then dissociating the salts to give the individual enantiomer of the free base.\nWhere compounds (e.g. of the formula (I)) exist as two or more optical isomeric forms, one enantiomer in a pair of enantiomers may exhibit advantages over the other enantiomer, for example, in terms of biological activity. Thus, in certain circumstances, it may be desirable to use as a therapeutic agent only one of a pair of enantiomers, or only one of a plurality of diastereoisomers. Accordingly, the invention provides compositions containing a compound of the formula (I) having one or more chiral centres, wherein at least 55% (e.g. at least 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90% or 95%) of the compound of the formula (I) is present as a single optical isomer (e.g. enantiomer or diastereoisomer). In one general embodiment, 99% or more (e.g. substantially all) of the total amount of the compound of the formula (I) may be present as a single optical isomer (e.g. enantiomer or diastereoisomer).\nThe compounds include compounds with one or more isotopic substitutions, and a reference to a particular element includes within its scope all isotopes of the element. For example, a reference to hydrogen includes within its scope 1H, 2H (D), and 3H (T). Similarly, references to carbon and oxygen include within their scope respectively 12C, 13C and 14C and 16O and 18O.\nThe isotopes may be radioactive or non-radioactive. In one embodiment of the invention, the compounds contain no radioactive isotopes. Such compounds are preferred for therapeutic use. In another embodiment, however, the compound may contain one or more radioisotopes. Compounds containing such radioisotopes may be useful in a diagnostic context.\nEsters such as carboxylic acid esters and acyloxy esters (e.g. of the compounds of formula (I)) bearing a carboxylic acid group or a hydroxyl group are also contemplated and are embraced by formula (I). Examples of esters are compounds containing the group \u2014C(\u2550O)OR, wherein R is an ester substituent, for example, a C1-7 alkyl group, a C3-20 heterocyclyl group, or a C5-20 aryl group, preferably a C1-7 alkyl group. Particular examples of ester groups include, but are not limited to, \u2014C(\u2550O)OCH3, \u2014C(\u2550O)OCH2CH3, \u2014C(\u2550O)OC(CH3)3, and \u2014C(\u2550O)OPh. Examples of acyloxy (reverse ester) groups are represented by \u2014OC(\u2550O)R, wherein R is an acyloxy substituent, for example, a C1-7 alkyl group, a C3-20 heterocyclyl group, or a C5-20 aryl group, preferably a C1-7 alkyl group. Particular examples of acyloxy groups include, but are not limited to, \u2014OC(\u2550O)CH3 (acetoxy), \u2014OC(\u2550O)CH2CH3, \u2014OC(\u2550O)C(CH3)3, \u2014OC(\u2550O)Ph, and \u2014OC(\u2550O)CH2Ph.\nIn one general embodiment, formula (I) and sub-formulae, sub-groups, preferences and examples thereof do not cover esters such as carboxylic acid esters and acyloxy esters.\nIn one particular embodiment, formula (I) and sub-formulae, sub-groups, preferences and examples thereof do not cover esters of hydroxy compounds wherein R2 is hydroxy and the ester is formed with the hydroxy group R2.\nAlso encompassed by formula (I) are any polymorphic forms of the compounds, solvates (e.g. hydrates), complexes (e.g. inclusion complexes or clathrates with compounds such as cyclodextrins, or complexes with metals) of the compounds, and pro-drugs of the compounds (e.g. the compounds of formula (I)). By \u201cprodrugs\u201d is meant for example any compound that is converted in vivo into a biologically active compound (e.g. into one or more ancillary compounds or into a compound of the formula (I)).\nFor example, some prodrugs are esters of the active compound (e.g., a physiologically acceptable metabolically labile ester). During metabolism, the ester group (\u2014C(\u2550O)OR) is cleaved to yield the active drug. Such esters may be formed by esterification, for example, of any of the carboxylic acid groups (\u2014C(\u2550O)OH) in the parent compound, with, where appropriate, prior protection of any other reactive groups present in the parent compound, followed by deprotection if required.\nExamples of such metabolically labile esters include those of the formula \u2014C(\u2550O)OR wherein R is:\n  C1-7alkyl (e.g., -Me, -Et, -nPr, -iPr, -nBu, -sBu, -iBu, -tBu); C1-7aminoalkyl (e.g., aminoethyl; 2-(N,N-diethylamino)ethyl; 2-(4-morpholino)ethyl); and acyloxy-C1-7alkyl (e.g., acyloxymethyl; acyloxyethyl; pivaloyloxymethyl; acetoxymethyl; 1-acetoxyethyl; 1-(1-methoxy-1-methyl)ethyl-carbonxyloxyethyl; 1-(benzoyloxy)ethyl; isopropoxy-carbonyloxymethyl; 1-isopropoxy-carbonyloxyethyl; cyclohexyl-carbonyloxymethyl; 1-cyclohexyl-carbonyloxyethyl; cyclohexyloxy-carbonyloxymethyl; 1-cyclohexyloxy-carbonyloxyethyl; (4-tetrahydropyranyloxy) carbonyloxymethyl; 1-(4-tetrahydropyranyloxy)carbonyloxyethyl; (4-tetrahydropyranyl)carbonyloxymethyl; and 1-(4-tetrahydropyranyl)carbonyloxyethyl). \nAlso, some prodrugs are activated enzymatically to yield the active compound, or a compound which, upon further chemical reaction, yields the active compound (for example, as in ADEPT, GDEPT, LIDEPT, etc.). For example, the prodrug may be a sugar derivative or other glycoside conjugate, or may be an amino acid ester derivative.\nBiological Activity and Therapeutic Uses\nCompounds of the formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VIa), (VII), (VIIa) or (VIIb), subgroups thereof, acid addition salts (particularly the L-lactate) and crystalline forms thereof for use in the combinations of the invention are inhibitors of Hsp90 and consequently are beneficial in the treatment of wide spectrum of proliferative disorders. Examples of such proliferative disorders are not limited to, but can be selected from, a carcinoma, for example a carcinoma of the bladder, breast, colon (e.g. colorectal carcinomas such as colon adenocarcinoma and colon adenoma), kidney, epidermis, liver, lung, for example adenocarcinoma, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung carcinomas, oesophagus, gall bladder, ovary, pancreas e.g. exocrine pancreatic carcinoma, stomach, cervix, thyroid, prostate, gastrointestinal system, e.g. gastrointestinal stromal tumours, or skin, for example squamous cell carcinoma; a hematopoieitic tumour of lymphoid lineage, for example leukaemia, acute lymphocytic leukaemia, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, B-cell lymphoma (such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma), T-cell lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, hairy cell lymphoma, or Burkitt's lymphoma; a hematopoieitic tumour of myeloid lineage, including acute myeloid leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemias, myelogenous leukaemias, and Imatinib sensitive and refractory chronic myelogenous leukaemias, myelodysplastic syndrome, Bortezomib sensitive and refractory multiple myeloma, myeloproliferative disease or promyelocytic leukaemia; thyroid follicular cancer; a tumour of mesenchymal origin, for example fibrosarcoma or habdomyosarcoma; a tumour of the central or peripheral nervous system, for example astrocytoma, neuroblastoma, glioma or schwannoma; melanoma; seminoma; teratocarcinoma; osteosarcoma; xeroderma pigmentosum; keratoacanthoma; thyroid follicular cancer; or Kaposi's sarcoma. A further example of a tumour of mesenchymal origin is Ewing's sarcoma.\nThe cancers may be cancers which are sensitive to Hsp90 inhibition, and such cancers may be determined by a method as set out in the section headed \u201cMethods of Diagnosis\u201d.\nOne group of cancers includes human breast cancers (e.g. primary breast tumours, node-negative breast cancer, invasive duct adenocarcinomas of the breast, non-endometrioid breast cancers); and mantle cell lymphomas. In addition, other cancers are colorectal and endometrial cancers.\nAnother sub-set of cancers includes hematopoietic tumours of both lymphoid and myeloid lineage, for example acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (Both T and B cell), acute myeloid leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia, mantle cell lymphoma and B-cell lymphoma (such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma) and optionally further includes chronic myelogenous leukaemia and multiple myeloma.\nA preferred sub-set of cancers consists of ErbB2-positive breast, prostate, lung, and gastric cancer; chronic myeloid leukemia; androgen receptor dependent prostate cancer; Flt3-dependent acute myeloid leukaemia; melanoma associated with Braf mutation; multiple myeloma; velcade refractory multiple myeloma; and gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST).\nOf these, particularly preferred cancers are multiple myelomas and velcade refractory tumour types as defined herein.\nAnother preferred sub-set of cancers consists of hormone refractory prostate cancer, metastatic melanoma, HER2 positive breast cancer, mutant EGFR positive non-small cell lung carcinoma and Gleevec resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumours.\nThe combinations of the invention can also be used to treat other conditions such as viral infections, parasitic disease, autoimmune diseases (e.g. multiple sclerosis and lupus erythematosus), neuro-degenerative disorders (e.g. Alzheimer's disease), inflammation, Type I and II diabetes, atherosclerosis and cardiac disease.\nThe combinations of the invention can also have clinical benefit in transplantation and immunosuppression.\nThe combinations of the invention can also have clinical benefit in the previously described diseases when used in combination with existing or new therapeutic agents.\nBased on the activities of Hsp90 client proteins and experimental evidence, the following disorders may be particularly sensitive to treatment by Hsp90 inhibitors.\nErbB2-Positive Breast, Prostate, Lung, and Gastric Cancer\nOverexpression of ErbB2 (HER-2) occurs in approximately 30% of breast cancers and ErbB2 receptor down-regulation by herceptin sensitized cells to Taxol. ErbB2 over-expression is linked to poor prognosis and drug resistance (Tsugawa et. al., 1993. Oncology 1993; 50: 418).\nMutant EGFR in Lung Cancer\nSomatic mutations in the kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), including L858R and exon 19 deletions, underlie responsiveness to gefitinib and erlotinib in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Acquired resistance to these tyrosine kinase inhibitors is in some cases mediated by a second mutation, T790M. Ansamycin antibiotics, such as geldanamycin, potently inhibit heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), promoting ubiquitin-mediated degradation of oncogenic kinases that require the chaperone for proper conformational folding. Exposure of EGFR-mutant cell lines to geldanamycin induced marked depletion of phospho-Akt and cyclin D1 as well as apoptosis. These data suggest mutational activation of EGFR is associated with dependence on Hsp90 for stability and that Hsp90 inhibition may represent a novel strategy for the treatment of EGFR-mutant NSCLC.\nChronic Myeloid Leukemia\nThe aberrant BCR-Abl protein is created through a chromosomal translocation and results in a constitutively active Abl kinase domain. This translocation event has been shown to be causal for CML. P210BcrAbl is a known client protein for Hsp90. Treatment of the BCR-Abl positive cell line K562 with an hsp90 inhibitor induced apoptosis. The Bcr-Abl inhibitor Gleevec\u00ae also induces apoptosis in K562 cells; however Gleevec\u00ae resistant K562 cells still retain sensitivity towards Hsp90 inhibitors (Gorre et. al. 2002, Blood 100: 3041-3044).\nAndrogen Receptor Dependent Prostate Cancer\nThe androgen receptor kinase is an Hsp90 client protein. Hormone replacement therapy is usually adopted where surgery does not resolve the cancer. The cancer may become refractory to hormone manipulation through receptor mutation. Hsp90 regulation of the receptor would still be viable post-mutation.\nThe same would apply to estrogen-dependent breast cancers.\nFlt3-Dependent Acute Myeloid Leukaemia\nInternal duplication of the tyrosine kinase receptor Flt3 leads to its constitutive activation and oncogenesis. These internal duplications are observed in 20% of all reported cases of AML and are an indication of poor prognosis. Much like the activation of the ABL kinase in CML, this represents another example of a single genetic lesion giving rise to a malignancy. Hsp90 inhibitors are predicted to be of clinical benefit to these patients as Flt3 is an Hsp90 client protein (Bali et. al., 2004 Cancer Res. 64(10):3645-52).\nMelanoma Associated with Braf Mutation\nBraf encodes for a serine/threonine kinase which is mutated in 70% of all melanomas. 80% of these represent a single V599E point mutation that confers elevated kinase activity to BRAF. This mutation is also transforming in NIH3T3 cells (Bignell et. al., 2002 Nature. 417(6892):949-54).\nMultiple Myeloma\nThe Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG potently inhibits proliferation of Bortezomib refractory multiple myeloma cell lines. Cell surface levels of IGF-1R and IL-6R were also diminished in 17-aag treated MM-1 cells (Mitsiades et. al., Blood 107:1092-1100, 2006). Autocrine stimulation of multiple myeloma cells, as well as paracrine stimulation of bone marrow stromal cells with IL-6 is also diminished through downregulation of the Hsp90 client IKK.\nVelcade Refractory Multiple Myeloma\nThe combinations of the invention can be used in the treatment of velcade refractory tumour types including treatment of patients with second line mantle cell lymphoma, indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, stage IIIB and IV Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, advanced non-small cell lung cancer, breast, prostate and ovarian cancers and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\nGastrointestinal Stromal Tumours (GIST)\nGIST disease particularly disease dependent on growth factor activation or overexpression (e.g. c-kit).\nB-CLL\nZAP-70 is an Hsp90 client protein and the requirement for Hsp90 by ZAP-70 is limited to CLL cells and is not observed in T cells where this kinase is normally expressed. Hence, ZAP-70 is unique among identified Hsp90 clients as its chaperone dependency is conditional on the type of cell in which it is expressed.\nOther conditions or disorders for which an Hsp90 inhibitor may be of clinical benefit include, but are not limited to:\nNeurodegenerative Disorders\nHuntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with no effective treatment. GA inhibition of Hsp90 and the resulting up-regulation of Hsps are effective in preventing huntington protein aggregation in neuronal cells. (Sittler et. al., 2001, Human Molecular Genetics, Vol. 10, No. 12 1307-1315). Up-regulation of HSP may also be of clinical benefit in other diseases of protein misfolding e.g., CJD and Alzheimer's.\nInflammatory Disease, Including Rheumatoid Arthritis, Asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, and Inflammatory Bowel Disease\nGA has been shown to dissociate HSF-1 from Hsp90 leading to the activation and nuclear translocation of HSF-1. HSF-1 subsequently acts as a transcription factor to induce HSP90 and Hsp70. The induction of Hsp70 has been implicated in the resolution of inflammation in an induced mouse model of edema (Ianaro et al., 2004 Human Molecular Genetics, 2001, Vol. 10, No. 12 1307-1315). Additionally GA treatment inhibited IkappaB kinase (IKK) activation by TNF-a or PMA. IkBa is a regulator of Nf-kB and Ap-1. (Broemer et. al. 2004). Ap-1 and Nf-kB is a major transcription factor leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Yeo et. al., 2004 Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 30; 320(3):816-24). The stability of pro-inflammatory cytokine transcripts is also regulated through inhibition of p38 MapK (Wax et. al., 2003. Rheumatism Vol. 48, No. 2, pp 541-550).\nAtherosclerosis\nIt is known that inflammatory and immune cells play a central role in the initiation and progression of human atherosclerosis (Rigan\u00f2 et al., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 2007, 1107:1-10) and it has been proposed that Hsp90 acts as an autoantigen in carotid atherosclerosis. Rigan\u00f2 et al. found specific antibodies and cells against Hsp90 in the sera of 60% of patients tested who were suffering from carotid atherosclerotic plaques but no specific antibodies and T cells against Hsp90 in the sera of healthy patients. Therefore, The combinations of the invention are useful in the treatment or prevention of atherosclerosis.\nAngiogenesis Related Disease, Including but not Limited to: Tumour Angiogenesis, Psoriasis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, and Diabetic Retinopathy\nInduction of angiogenesis is regulated by Hsp90 client proteins eNOS and Akt in endothelial cells (Sun and Liao, 2004 Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 24(12):2238-44). Suppression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1a can also impair the growth, angiogenesis and vessel maturation of gastric tumours in a mouse model. (Stoeltzing et. al., 2004 J Natl Cancer Inst; 96:946-956.).\nType I and Type II Diabetes\nHsp90 inhibition has a profound effect on Akt signalling as well as e-nos. These are two key regulators in high glucose induced endothelial cell apoptosis in type I diabetes (Lin et. al., 2005 J Cell Biochem. 1; 94(1):194-201) and the development of hypertension in type II diabetes (Kobayashi et. al., 2004 Hypertension. 44(6):956-62.).\nImmunosuppression and Transplantation\nHsp90 inhibition has been shown to down regulate Lck, a T-cell specific tyrosine kinase required for T-cell activation. (Yorgin et. al., 2000 J. Immunol. 15; 164(6):2915-23.)\nCardiac Disease\nCardiac ischemic is the most common cause of death in the western world. Hsps, and notably Hsp70 (induced by radicicol treatment) have demonstrated cardioprotective activity in rat cardiomyocytes (Griffin et. al., 2004). Inhibition of Hsp90 results in the release of HSF-1 from the chaperone complex and its subsequent activation of Hsp genes. Inhibition of Hsp90 also leads to the down-regulation of HIF-1, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ischemic heart disease and stroke.\nInfectious Disease and Anti-Viral Activity\nHepatits C viral NS2/3 protease is an Hsp90 client protein and Hsp90 activity is required for viral processing and replication (Whitney et. al., 2001. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 20; 98(24):13931-5).\nAs discussed above in the introductory sections of this application, infection of a host cell with viral RNA/DNA results in a substantial redirection of cellular protein synthesis towards key viral proteins encoded by the viral nucleic acid, and this frequently gives rise to upregulation of heat shock proteins. It is believed that one function of the HSP induction may be to assist in the stabilization and folding of the high levels of \u2018foreign\u2019 protein generated in preparation for virus replication and it has been shown (Nadkadawa et al.) that HSP 90 inhibitors can block viral replication. Accordingly, the compounds of the invention are useful in combating viral infections, for example by blocking or inhibiting viral replication.\nTherefore, in another aspect, the invention provides a compound of the invention as defined herein for use in the prophylaxis or treatment of a viral infection (or viral disease).\nIn further aspects, the invention provides:\n    The use of a compound of the invention as defined herein for the manufacture of a medicament for the prophylaxis or treatment of a viral infection (or viral disease).

A pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the invention as defined herein with an ancilliary compound which is an antiviral agent.\n\nParasitic Disease\n   \nGA has reported antimalarial activity against an Hsp90 ortholog of Plasmodium falciparum. Plasmodium growth was inhibited with GA at an IC50 similar to that observed with chloroquine. GA was also effective against chloroquine resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum (Kamar et. al., 2003. Malar J. 15; 2(1):30).\nThe biological activity of the compounds for use in the invention, e.g. as inhibitors of Hsp90, can be measured using the assays set forth in the examples below, for example the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments described in Example 80 and the anti-proliferative activity assays described in Example 81. The level of activity exhibited by a given compound in the ITC assay can be defined in terms of the Kd value, and preferred compounds for use in the present invention are compounds having a Kd value of less than 1 micromolar, more preferably less than 0.1 micromolar. In the anti-proliferative activity assays, the level of activity exhibited by a given compound in an assay can be defined in terms of the IC50 value, and preferred compounds for use in the present invention are compounds having an IC50 value of less than 1 micromolar, more preferably less than 0.1 micromolar.\nhERG\nIn the late 1990s a number of drugs, approved by the US FDA, had to be withdrawn from sale in the US when it was discovered they were implicated in deaths caused by heart malfunction. It was subsequently found that a side effect of these drugs was the development of arrhythmias caused by the blocking of hERG channels in heart cells. The hERG channel is one of a family of potassium ion channels the first member of which was identified in the late 1980s in a mutant Drosophila melanogaster fruitfly (see Jan, L. Y. and Jan, Y. N. (1990). A Superfamily of Ion Channels. Nature, 345(6277):672). The biophysical properties of the hERG potassium ion channel are described in Sanguinetti, M. C., Jiang, C., Curran, M. E., and Keating, M. T. (1995). A Mechanistic Link Between an Inherited and an Acquired Cardiac Arrhythmia: HERG encodes the Ikr potassium channel. Cell, 81:299-307, and Trudeau, M. C., Warmke, J. W., Ganetzky, B., and Robertson, G. A. (1995). HERG, a Human Inward Rectifier in the Voltage-Gated Potassium Channel Family. Science, 269:92-95.\nThe elimination of hERG blocking activity remains an important consideration in the development of any new drug.\nIt has also been found that many compounds of the formula (I) have low hERG activity and a good separation between Hsp90 inhibitory activity and hERG activity.\nPreferred compounds of the formula (I) have mean IC50 values against hERG that are greater than 30 times, or greater than 40 times, or greater than 50 times the IC50 values of the compounds in cellular proliferation assays. Preferred compounds of the formula (I) have mean IC50 values against hERG that are greater than 5 \u03bcM, more particularly greater than 10 \u03bcM, and more preferably greater than 15 \u03bcM. Some compounds for use according to the invention have mean IC50 values against hERG that are greater than 50 \u03bcM.\nCompounds for use in the invention have advantageous ADME properties and in particular better tumour distribution.\nHsps and Antitumour Drug Resistance\nTherapeutic anticancer interventions of all types necessarily increase the stresses imposed on the target tumour cells. In mitigating the deleterious effects of such stresses, Hsps are directly implicated in resisting the effects of cancer drugs and treatment regimens. Thus, modulators or inhibitors of stress protein function in general (and Hsp90 in particular) represent a class of chemotherapeutics with the potential for: (i) sensitizing malignant cells to anticancer drugs and/or treatments; (ii) alleviating or reducing the incidence of resistance to anticancer drugs and/or treatments; (iii) reversing resistance to anticancer drugs and/or treatments; (iv) potentiating the activity of anticancer drugs and/or treatments; (v) delaying or preventing the onset of resistance to anticancer drugs and/or treatments.\nMethods for the Preparation of Compounds of the Formula (I)\nIn this section, as in all other sections of this application unless the context indicates otherwise, references to formula (I)) includes all subgroups of formula (I) as defined herein, including formulae (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VIa), (VII), (VIIa) and (VIIb) (in particular formula (VI) and the acid addition salts, particularly the L-lactate, and crystalline forms thereof) and the term \u2018subgroups\u2019 includes all preferences, embodiments, examples and particular compounds defined herein.\nWhere a reference is made to a group R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R10 or any other \u201cR\u201d group, the definition of the group in question is as set out above and as set out in the following sections of this application unless the context requires otherwise.\nCompounds of the formula (I) can be prepared in accordance with synthetic methods well known to the skilled person. For example, compounds of the formula (I) can be prepared by the reaction of a compound of the formula (X):\n              \nor an activated and/or protected form thereof, with an amine of the formula HNR5R6 under conditions suitable for forming an amide bond, and thereafter where necessary removing any protecting groups and optionally converting one compound of the formula (I) to another compound of the formula (I).\n\nThe amines of the formula HNR5R6 are either commercially available or can be made using methods well known to the skilled person, see for example, Advanced Organic Chemistry, by Jerry March, 4th edition, 119, Wiley Interscience, New York; Fiesers' Reagents for Organic Synthesis, Volumes 1-17, John Wiley, edited by Mary Fieser (ISBN: 0-471-58283-2); and Organic Syntheses, Volumes 1-8, John Wiley, edited by Jeremiah P. Freeman (ISBN: 0-471-31192-8).\nThe carboxylic acid (X) can be converted to an amide of the formula (I) by first forming an acid chloride by treatment of the carboxylic acid with thionyl chloride, or by reaction with oxalyl chloride in the presence of a catalytic amount of dimethyl formamide, or by reaction of a potassium salt of the acid with oxalyl chloride. The acid chloride can then be reacted with the amine HNR5R6 in the presence of a non-interfering base such as triethylamine. The reaction may be carried out at around room temperature in a polar solvent such as dioxan.\nAs an alternative to using the acid chloride method described above, the carboxylic acid (X) can be converted to the amide (I) by reaction with the amine HNR5R6 in the presence of amide coupling reagents of the type commonly used in the formation of peptide linkages. Examples of such reagents include 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) (Sheehan et al, J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1955, 77, 1067), 1-ethyl-3-(3\u2032-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (referred to herein either as EDC or EDAC but also known in the art as EDCI and WSCDI) (Sheehan et al, J. Org. Chem., 1961, 26, 2525), uronium-based coupling agents such as O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU) and phosphonium-based coupling agents such as 1-benzo-triazolyloxytris-(pyrrolidino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP) (Castro et al, Tetrahedron Letters, 1990, 31, 205). Carbodiimide-based coupling agents are advantageously used in combination with 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole (HOAt) (L. A. Carpino, J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 1993, 115, 4397) or 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) (Konig et al, Chem. Ber., 103, 708, 2024-2034). Preferred coupling reagents include EDC (EDAC) and DCC in combination with HOAt or HOBt.\nThe coupling reaction is typically carried out in a non-aqueous, non-protic solvent such as acetonitrile, dioxan, dimethylsulphoxide, dichloromethane, dimethylformamide or N-methylpyrrolidine, or in an aqueous solvent optionally together with one or more miscible co-solvents. The reaction can be carried out at room temperature or, where the reactants are less reactive (for example in the case of electron-poor anilines bearing electron withdrawing groups such as sulphonamide groups) at an appropriately elevated temperature. The reaction may be carried out in the presence of a non-interfering base, for example a tertiary amine such as triethylamine or N,N-diisopropylethylamine.\nIllustrative routes to the compounds of formula (I) are described in more detail below.\nCompounds of the formula (I) in which the benzoyl moiety is derived from a 2-hydroxy-5-substituted benzoic acid can be prepared by the sequence of reactions shown in Scheme 1.\nThe starting material for the synthetic route shown in Scheme 1 is 5-chloro-2-hydroxy benzoic acid, which can be obtained commercially. Conversion to the acid chloride is carried out by heating with thionyl chloride. The acid chloride may be used either in situ and reacted with various amines, or can be isolated as a stable white solid. Other simple 2-hydroxy-5-substituted benzoic acids may be used in this procedure to synthesise other amides of 2-hydroxy-5-substituted benzoic acids.\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nCompounds of formula (I) can also be made according to the method shown in Scheme 2. The starting material for the synthetic route shown in Scheme 2 is 4-ethyl anisole, which can be obtained commercially. Conversion to the carboxylic acid can be carried out by lithiation at low temperature, followed by quenching of the resulting anion with solid carbon dioxide. The carboxylic acid may be coupled with various amines, using standard amide coupling reagents of the type commonly used in the formation of peptide linkages as described above.\nDeprotection of the methyl ether can be effected using boron tribromide (e.g. by the method described in Synthesis 1991, 469) to give the compound of formula (I). The method illustrated in Scheme 2 can be used to prepare other simple 2-hydroxy-5-substituted benzoic acids which can then be coupled to an appropriate amine to give the compounds of formula (I). The process of coupling intermediates acids with amines, anilines or amino-heterocyclic compounds, followed by removal of any protecting groups, is straightforward and is suitable for the synthesis of large combinatorial libraries of molecules, useful for this invention. Examples of combinatorial libraries are described in Solid-Phase Synthesis and Combinatorial Technologies by Pierfausto Seneci. Wiley-Interscience, New York. 2000. xii+637 pp. ISBN 0471331953).\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nCompounds of the Formula (I) can also be made according to the methods described in Scheme 3. The starting material 3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (X=tert-butyl) is commercially available and can be coupled using the amide coupling agents (as outlined above) with a broad range of amines of the formula HNR5R6 to give compounds for use according to the invention. The other starting material illustrated in Scheme 3,3-isopropyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (X=isopropyl), can be prepared according to a modification of a literature procedure using carbon tetrachloride and copper powder in a Friedel-Crafts type reaction, in which the intermediate species is hydrolysed to the carboxylic acid (J Chem Soc, Chem Commun 1985, 1134). The Friedel Crafts method can be used to prepare other simple 2-hydroxy-3-substituted benzoic acids.\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nCompounds of the formula (I) can also be made according to the method described in Scheme 4. 2,4-Dihydroxy-5-isopropyl-benzoic acid amides can be prepared by amide coupling using coupling reagents (as outlined above) from a bi-benzyl ether protected intermediate, shown in the scheme, followed by catalytic hydrogenation using hydrogen gas and palladium on carbon. The benzoic acid intermediate itself is made by Friedel-Crafts acylation of 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid methyl ester (from commercial sources) using a literature procedure (J. Ind. Chem. Soc., 1953, 30, 269). Typically, Friedel-Crafts acylation of a phenol is carried out by treatment of the phenol with an acylating agent (such as an acid chloride or acid anhydride) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (such as boron trifluoride or aluminium chloride) either at room temperature or at more elevated temperatures (60-120\u00b0 C.). Benzyl protection of the phenol groups, the Wittig reaction of the ketone to the olefin and ester hydrolysis (saponification) can be carried out under standard conditions, well known to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis (for example see, Advanced Organic Chemistry, by Jerry March, 4th edition, 119, Wiley Interscience, New York; Fiesers' Reagents for Organic Synthesis, Volumes 1-17, John Wiley, edited by Mary Fieser (ISBN: 0-471-58283-2); and Organic Syntheses, Volumes 1-8, John Wiley, edited by Jeremiah P. Freeman (ISBN: 0-471-31192-8). For example, the Wittig reaction can be carried out in an inert polar solvent (such as tetrahydrofuran) and can involve treatment of an aldehyde or ketone with a phosphorus ylide species that may be prepared by the reaction of a phosphonium salt with a base (such as butyl lithium or potassium tert-butoxide). The ester hydrolysis to the carboxylic acid is usually carried out by treatment with an aqueous alkali metal hydroxide such sodium hydroxide. The saponification reaction may be carried out using an organic co-solvent such as an alcohol (e.g. methanol) and the reaction mixture is typically heated to a non-extreme temperature, for example up to about 50-60\u00b0 C.\nIt is to be understood that other 2,4-dihydroxy-5-substituted benzoic acids could be made using this procedure to synthesise different examples of compounds of formula I not specifically exemplified herein.\nIn Scheme 4, as an alternative to the use of the Wittig reagent MePPH3Br to form the olefin (XXVI), the ketone (XXV) can be reacted with methyl magnesium bromide under standard Grignard reaction conditions to give an intermediate hydroxy compound which is then dehydrated to the olefin by reaction with a suitable reagent such as sodium acetate and acetic acid.\nThe intermediate compound 2,4-bis-benzyloxy-5-isopropenyl-benzoic acid (XXVII) and its precursor compounds (XXV) and (XXVI) shown in Scheme 4 are believed to be novel and, as such, each of the compounds represents a further aspect of the invention.\nThe 2,4-bis-benzyloxy-5-isopropenyl-benzoic acid amides (XXVIII) are also believed to be novel and also form a further aspect of the invention.\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nThe intermediate compound 2,4-bis-benzyloxy-5-isopropenyl-benzoic acid (XXVII) in Scheme 4 can be made using a variety of methods well known to the skilled person. For example, compound (XXVII) can be made by the synthetic route illustrated in Scheme 4A.\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nAs shown in Scheme 4A, 5-bromo-2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid is benzylated using benzyl bromide in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate to give the bis-benzyloxy-bromobenzoic acid benzyl ester (XXX). The ester (XXX) is then reacted with potassium isoprenyl trifluoroborate in the presence of a palladium (0) or palladium (II) compound and a base to give the isopropenyl-bis benzyl ester (XXXI). The palladium compound can be a palladium (0) compound such as Pd(PPh3)4 or a palladium (II) compound such as [1,1\u2032-bis(diphenyl-phosphino)ferrocene]dichloropalladium(II). The base can be an organic base such as n-butylamine or an inorganic base such as a metal carbonate, e.g. caesium carbonate. The reaction with potassium isoprenyl trifluoroborate is typically carried out at reflux temperature for a prolonged period, for example 15 hours or more. The resulting isopropenyl bis-benzyloxy ester (XXXI) is then hydrolysed to give the carboxylic acid (XXVII) using, for example, an alkali metal hydroxide such as lithium hydroxide, typically with heating to a non-extreme temperature.\nCompounds of the formula (I) can also be made according to the route illustrated in Scheme 5. 4-Hydroxy-3-(1\u2032,2\u2032-dimethyl-propyl)-benzoic acid amides can be prepared by amide coupling using standard coupling agents (as outlined above) from the alkyl substituted acid. The olefinic acid itself can be prepared by Claisen rearrangement of a precursor ether, as shown in the scheme, by thermal rearrangement in anisole, followed by saponification, which in this case can yield more than one isomer of the olefin, the major one being shown in the scheme. Such Claisen reactions are well known in the literature, e.g. see J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans 1 1981, 897. The ether itself can be prepared by simple alkylation of commercially available 4-hydroxy benzoic acid ethyl ester. The alkylation and saponification reactions are simple modifications that can be carried out under various conditions (for example see, Advanced Organic Chemistry, by Jerry March, 4th edition, 119, Wiley Interscience, New York; Fiesers' Reagents for Organic Synthesis, Volumes 1-17, John Wiley, edited by Mary Fieser (ISBN: 0-471-58283-2); and Organic Syntheses, Volumes 1-8, John Wiley, edited by Jeremiah P. Freeman (ISBN: 0-471-31192-8)). It is to be understood that other 4-hydroxy-3-substituted benzoic acids could be made using this procedure to synthesise different examples of compounds of formula 1 not specifically exemplified herein.\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nCompounds of the formula (I) can also be made according to the method shown in Scheme 6. 2,4-Dihydroxy-5-bromobenzoic acid is used as the starting material, which is commercially available. Simple protection and deprotection gives the benzoic acid precursor (for example see, Advanced Organic Chemistry, by Jerry March, 4th edition, 119, Wiley Interscience, New York; Fiesers' Reagents for Organic Synthesis, Volumes 1-17, John Wiley, edited by Mary Fieser (ISBN: 0-471-58283-2); and Organic Syntheses, Volumes 1-8, John Wiley, edited by Jeremiah P. Freeman (ISBN: 0-471-31192-8)), which can be used in amide coupling reactions with a range of amines (as outlined above). These precursor amides can be subjected to Suzuki cross coupling procedures to make alkyl substituted compounds. A broad range of Suzuki coupling conditions are described in the literature, and the ones used here were taken from J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003, 11148. Suzuki coupling chemistry is also broadly applicable to synthesis of alkyl-aryl and aryl-aryl compounds. The Suzuki reaction is typically carried out in the presence of a palladium catalyst such as bis(tri-t-butylphosphine)-palladium and a base (e.g. a carbonate such as potassium carbonate). The reaction may be carried out in an aqueous solvent system, for example aqueous ethanol, and the reaction mixture is typically subjected to heating, for example to a temperature in excess of 100\u00b0 C. Many boronates suitable for use in preparing compounds for use according to the invention are commercially available, for example from Boron Molecular Limited of Noble Park, Australia, or from Combi-Blocks Inc, of San Diego, USA. Where the boronates are not commercially available, they can be prepared by methods known in the art, for example as described in the review article by N. Miyaura and A. Suzuki, Chem. Rev. 1995, 95, 2457. Thus, boronates can be prepared by reacting the corresponding bromo-compound with an alkyl lithium such as butyl lithium and then reacting with a borate ester. The resulting boronate ester derivative can, if desired, be hydrolysed to give the corresponding boronic acid. The final products of the reaction sequence illustrated in Scheme 6 are formed by catalytic hydrogenation (as outlined above) to remove the benzyl protecting groups and to reduce the olefin, formed in the Suzuki reaction to the alkyl substituent. It is to be understood that other 2,4-dihydroxy-5-substituted benzoic acids could be made using this procedure to synthesise different examples of compounds of formula I not specifically exemplified herein.\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nCompounds of the formula (I) wherein NR5R6 is an optionally substituted isoindoline group, for example as in compounds of the formulae (VII) and (VIIa), can be prepared by the methods illustrated in Scheme 7, or methods analogous thereto.\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nAs shown in Scheme 7, an optionally substituted 1,2-dimethylbenzene (XI) is heated with N-bromosuccinimide in the presence of dibenzoyl peroxide to give the dibromo-compound (XII). The reaction is typically carried out in carbon tetrachloride with heating at reflux. The dibromo-compound (XII) is then reacted with a compound PG-NH2 where PG is a protecting group such as tosyl or para-methoxybenzyl in the presence of a base such as a metal hydride (e.g. sodium hydride), when PG is a tosyl group, or an alkali metal carbonate (e.g. sodium carbonate), when PG is para-methoxybenzyl. The protecting group PG can then be removed to give the amine (XIV). Thus, for example, a tosyl group can be removed by heating with a mixture of phenol, hydrobromic acid and propanoic acid, whereas a para-methoxybenzyl group can be removed in standard manner using trifluoroacetic acid and anisole. The amine (XIV) is then coupled with a carboxylic acid of the formula (X) as described above.\nIn a variation on the reaction sequence of Scheme 7, one or more functional groups R10b present in the protected isoindoline (XIII) or the deprotected isoindoline compound (XIV) can be converted into other groups R10b. For example, where the group R10b in compound (XIV) is a nitro group, it can be reduced to give the corresponding amino group, for example by catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of a palladium on charcoal catalyst. In a further example, when R10b in the compound (XIII) is an ester group (e.g. CO2Me), it can be hydrolysed to give a carboxylic acid which can then be reacted with an amine such as morpholine to give the corresponding amide. Further functional group interconversions may subsequently be carried out (for example reduction of the amide to the corresponding aminomethyl compound with lithium aluminium hydride) before removal of the protecting group PG.\nAn alternative synthesis of the isoindoline compound (XIV) is shown in Scheme 8.\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nThe starting material for Scheme 8 is the ortho diester (XV) which is hydrolysed to the corresponding dicarboxylic acid (XVI) using an alkali metal hydroxide such as potassium hydroxide before being subjected to cyclisation to the phthalic anhydride (XVII) by reaction with acetic anhydride. The phthalic anhydride (XVII) can be converted to the corresponding phthalimide (XVIII) by reaction with formamide at an elevated temperature (e.g. approximately 210\u00b0 C.). The phthalimide (XVIII) can then be reduced to the isoindoline (XIV) using a suitable reducing agent such as borane in tetrahydrofuran.\nCompounds of the formula (VIIb) as defined herein can be prepared by the reaction of a compound of the formula (XIX) or a protected derivative thereof with a compound of the formula (XX):\n              \nwherein n, R3, R4a, R8 and R10cc are as defined herein, under amide forming conditions as described above and in the examples.\n\nMany of the compounds of formula (XX) are novel and, as such, form another aspect of the invention. Thus, in another aspect, the invention provides a compound of the formula (XX) but excluding any and all compounds known per se in the prior art.\nWithin formula (XX), particular intermediates can be represented by the formula (XXI):\n              \nwherein n is 0 or 1; M is N or CHOH and R25 is hydrogen or methyl; provided that when n is 0 and R25 is methyl, then M is CHOH.\n\nParticular intermediates within formula (XXI) are the compounds (XXII), (XXIII) and (XXIV) below.\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nThe intermediates of formula (XXI) can be made by methods well known to the skilled person or methods analogous thereto. For example, intermediate XXII can be prepared by lithium-halogen exchange of a suitably N-protected 5-bromoisoindoline, quenching with 1-methyl-4-piperidone and subsequent deprotection. Intermediate XXII can be prepared by Buchwald palladium coupling of 4-BOC-piperazine and a suitably N-protected 5-bromoisoindoline followed by subsequent deprotection. One method of preparation for intermediate XXIV is from a suitably N-protected isoindoline-5-carboxylic acid, Weinreb amide formation, reduction to the aldehyde, followed by reductive amination and subsequent deprotection.\nOnce formed, where the substituent groups permit, one compound of the formula (I), or a protected form thereof, can be converted into another compound of the formula (I).\nFor example, when R1 and R2 are both protected hydroxy groups (e.g. benzyloxy groups), and R3 is bromine, the bromine atom can be replaced by trifluoromethyl by reaction with a trifluoroacetate salt (e.g. sodium trifluoroacetate), and copper (I) iodide in a polar solvent such as dimethylformamide.\nIn another procedure, compounds of the formula (I) wherein R5 is fluorine can be prepared from compounds of the formula (I) where R5 is hydrogen by electrophilic fluorination. Electrophilic fluorination can be carried out using a fluorinating agent such as 1-(chloromethyl)-4-fluoro-1,4-diazoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane bis(tetrafluoroborate) or similar N-fluoro-diazonia compounds.\nIn a further procedure, compounds of the formula (I) wherein R1 and R2 are both hydroxy groups can be monomethylated to give a compound where one of R1 and R2 is a methoxy group by reaction with one equivalent of a methylating agent such as dimethylsulphate. The methylation reaction is typically carried out in a polar solvent such as acetonitrile in the presence of a base, for example an alkali metal carbonate such as potassium carbonate. Analogous methylation reactions may also be carried out on intermediate compounds containing two phenolic hydroxy groups.\nMany of the procedures described below and used in this synthesis are well known to those skilled in the art, and examples of alkylations, acylations, functional group interconversions and reagents and conditions for carrying out such conversions can be found in, for example, Advanced Organic Chemistry, by Jerry March, 4th edition, 119, Wiley Interscience, New York; Fiesers' Reagents for Organic Synthesis, Volumes 1-17, John Wiley, edited by Mary Fieser (ISBN: 0-471-58283-2); and Organic Syntheses, Volumes 1-8, John Wiley, edited by Jeremiah P. Freeman (ISBN: 0-471-31192-8).\nAs well as the specific examples, and the methods of preparation outlined below, it is understood that modification to the routes described would allow synthesis of many further examples of compounds claimed in Formula I. For example, alternative benzoic acid starting materials with differing or additional substitution patterns could be prepared.\nIn many of the reactions described above, it may be necessary to protect one or more groups to prevent reaction from taking place at an undesirable location on the molecule. Examples of protecting groups, and methods of protecting and deprotecting functional groups, can be found in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (T. Green and P. Wuts; 3rd Edition; John Wiley and Sons, 1999).\nA hydroxy group may be protected, for example, as an ether (\u2014OR) or an ester (\u2014OC(\u2550O)R), for example, as: a t-butyl ether; a benzyl, benzhydryl (diphenylmethyl), or trityl (triphenylmethyl)ether; a trimethylsilyl or t-butyldimethylsilyl ether; or an acetyl ester (\u2014OC(\u2550O)CH3, \u2014OAc). When the hydroxy group is a phenolic hydroxy group, for example in compounds of the formula (I) wherein R1 and/or R2 are hydroxy, a preferred protecting group is a benzyl group.\nAn aldehyde or ketone group may be protected, for example, as an acetal (R\u2014CH(OR)2) or ketal (R2C(OR)2), respectively, in which the carbonyl group (>C\u2550O) is converted to a diether (>C(OR)2), by reaction with, for example, a primary alcohol. The aldehyde or ketone group is readily regenerated by hydrolysis using a large excess of water in the presence of acid. An amine group may be protected, for example, as an amide (\u2014NRCO\u2014R) or a urethane (\u2014NRCO\u2014OR), for example, as: a methyl amide (\u2014NHCO\u2014CH3); a benzyloxy amide (\u2014NHCO\u2014OCH2C6H5, \u2014NH-Cbz); as a t-butoxy amide (\u2014NHCO\u2014OC(CH3)3, \u2014NH-Boc); a 2-biphenyl-2-propoxy amide (\u2014NHCO\u2014OC(CH3)2C6H4C6H5, \u2014NH-Bpoc), as a 9-fluorenylmethoxy amide (\u2014NH-Fmoc), as a 6-nitroveratryloxy amide (\u2014NH-Nvoc), as a 2-trimethylsilylethyloxy amide (\u2014NH-Teoc), as a 2,2,2-trichloroethyloxy amide (\u2014NH-Troc), as an allyloxy amide (\u2014NH-Alloc), or as a 2(-phenylsulphonyl)ethyloxy amide (\u2014NH-Psec). Other protecting groups for amines, such as cyclic amines and heterocyclic N\u2014H groups, include toluenesulphonyl (tosyl) and methanesulphonyl (mesyl) groups and benzyl groups such as a para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group. A carboxylic acid group may be protected as an ester for example, as: an C1-7 alkyl ester (e.g., a methyl ester; a t-butyl ester); a C1-7 haloalkyl ester (e.g., a C1-7 trihaloalkyl ester); a triC1-7alkylsilyl-C1-7alkyl ester; or a C5-20 aryl-C1-7, alkyl ester (e.g., a benzyl ester; a nitrobenzyl ester); or as an amide, for example, as a methyl amide. A thiol group may be protected, for example, as a thioether (\u2014SR), for example, as: a benzyl thioether; an acetamidomethyl ether (\u2014S\u2014CH2NHC(\u2550O)CH3).\nMethods of Purification of the Compounds of Formula (I)\nThe compounds may be isolated and purified by a number of methods well known to those skilled in the art and examples of such methods include chromatographic techniques such as column chromatography (e.g. flash chromatography) and HPLC. Preparative LC-MS is a standard and effective method used for the purification of small organic molecules such as the compounds described herein. The methods for the liquid chromatography (LC) and mass spectrometry (MS) can be varied to provide better separation of the crude materials and improved detection of the samples by MS. Optimisation of the preparative gradient LC method will involve varying columns, volatile eluents and modifiers, and gradients. Methods are well known in the art for optimising preparative LC-MS methods and then using them to purify compounds. Such methods are described in Rosentreter U, Huber U.; Optimal fraction collecting in preparative LC/MS; J Comb Chem.; 2004; 6(2), 159-64 and Leister W, Strauss K, Wisnoski D, Zhao Z, Lindsley C., Development of a custom high-throughput preparative liquid chromatography/mass spectrometer platform for the preparative purification and analytical analysis of compound libraries; J Comb Chem.; 2003; 5(3); 322-9.\nAlternatively, normal phase preparative LC based methods might be used in place of reverse phase methods. Most preparative LC-MS systems utilise reverse phase LC and volatile acidic modifiers, since the approach is very effective for the purification of small molecules and because the eluents are compatible with positive ion electrospray mass spectrometry. Employing other chromatographic solutions e.g. normal phase LC, alternatively buffered mobile phase, basic modifiers etc as outlined in the analytical methods described above could alternatively be used to purify the compounds.\nAncillary Compounds for Use According to the Invention\nAny of a wide variety of ancillary compounds may be used in the combinations of the invention.

Hormones, Hormone Agonists, Hormone Antagonists and Hormone Modulating Agents\nDefinition: The terms \u201ccorticosteroid\u201d, \u201cantiandrogen\u201d, \u201cantiestrogen\u201d, \u201cantiandrogen agent\u201d and \u201cantiestrogen agent\u201d as used herein refers to those described herein and analogues thereof, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.\nBiological activity: The hormones, hormone agonists, hormone antagonists and hormone modulating agents (including the antiandrogens and antiestrogen agents) working via one or more pharmacological actions as described herein have been identified as suitable anti-cancer agents. The term \u2018hormonal therapies\u2019 is used to collectively to refer to hormones, hormone agonists, hormone antagonists and hormone modulating agents.\nTechnical background: Hormonal therapy plays an important role in the treatment of certain types of cancer where tumours are formed in tissues that are sensitive to hormonal growth control such as the breast and prostate. Thus, for example, estrogen promotes growth of certain breast cancers and testosterone promotes growth of prostate cancers. Since the growth of such tumours is dependent on specific hormones, considerable research has been carried out to investigate whether it is possible to affect tumour growth by increasing or decreasing the levels of certain hormones in the body. Hormonal therapy attempts to control tumour growth in these hormone-sensitive tissues by manipulating the activity of the hormones.\nCancers which are derived from either lymphocyte precursors or mature lymphocytes such as certain types of leukemia, Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma often retain the sensitivity to treatment with corticosteroids including prednisolone, predisone and dexamethasone exhibited by mature lymphophocytes. As a consequence treatment with one or more corticosteroids is often incorporated into the treatment of these diseases. Thus contemplated for use with the invention are corticosteroids.\nWith regard to breast cancer, tumour growth is stimulated by estrogen, and antiestrogen agents have therefore been proposed and widely used for the treatment of this type of cancer. One of the most widely used of such agents is tamoxifen which is a competitive inhibitor of estradiol binding to the estrogen receptor (ER). When bound to the ER, tamoxifen induces a change in the three-dimensional shape of the receptor, inhibiting its binding to the estrogen responsive element on DNA. Under normal physiological conditions, estrogen stimulation increases tumour cell production of transforming growth cell b (TGF-b), an autocrine inhibitor of tumour cell growth. By blocking these pathways, the net effect of tamoxifen treatment is to decrease the autocrine stimulation of breast cancer growth. In addition, tamoxifen decreases the local production of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) by surrounding tissues: IGF-I is a paracrine growth factor for the breast cancer cell (Jordan and Murphy, Endocr. Rev., 1990, 1 1; 578-610). An alternative approach to disease control is to reduce circulating levels of estradiol by inhibition of aromatase\u2014an enzyme which is critical for its production. Both Tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors including anastrazole, letrozole and examestane are widely used in the treatment of post-menopausal women with breast cancer both in the adjuvant and metatsatic setting (e.g. metastatic breast cancer). Tamoxifen is also used in pre-menopausal women with ER-positive tumours. There are various potential side-effects of long-term tamoxifen treatment, for example the possibility of endometrial cancer and the occurrence of thrombo-embolic events. Although aromatase inhibitors are generally better tolerated than tamoxifen patients often experience musculo-skeletal pain and significant bone loss leading to osteoporosis.\nOther estrogen receptor antagonists (or selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs)) with broadly similar action to tamoxifen include toremifene and raloxifene. Toremifene is a non-steroidal SERM, which has the chemical name 2-(4-[(Z)-4-chloro-1,2-diphenyl-1-butenyl]-phenoxy)-N,N-dimethylethylamine, and is used for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, side-effects including hot flushes, nausea and dizziness. Raloxifene is a benzothiophene SERM, which has the chemical name [6-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)benzo[b]thien-3-yl]-[4-[2-(1-piperidinyl)ethoxy]-phenyl]-methanone hydrochloride, and is being investigated for the treatment of breast cancer, side-effects including hot flushes and leg cramps.\nFulvestrant, which acts by reducing the expression of the ER in tumour tissue has the chemical name 7-\u03b1-[9-(4,4,5,5,5-pentafluoropentylsulphinyl)-nonyl]estra-1,3,5-(10)-triene-3,17-beta-diol, is often used following treatment with tamoxifen and an aromatase inhibitor (e.g. as a second line treatment of advanced breast cancer). Treatment may be accompanied by hot flushes and endometrial stimulation.\nProstate cancer cells almost invariably overexpress the androgen receptor, and thus antiandrogens are widely used in the treatment of the disease. Antiandrogens are androgen receptor antagonists which bind to the androgen receptor and prevent dihydrotestosterone from binding. Dihydrotestosterone stimulates new growth of prostate cells, including cancerous prostate cells. An example of an antiadrogen is bicalutamide, which has the chemical name (R,S)\u2014N-(4-cyano-3-(4-fluorophenylsulfonyl)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)propanamide, and has been approved for use in combination with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogs for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer, side effects including hot flushes, bone pain, hematuria and gastro-intestinal symptoms. An alternative means of reducing circulating levels of dihydrotestosterone is to directly inhibit its production from testosterone using flutamide.\nIn one embodiment the hormonal therapies include fulvestrant, toremifene and raloxifene.\nA further type of hormonal cancer treatment comprises the use of progestin analogs. Progestin is the synthetic form of progesterone, a hormone secreted by the ovaries and endometrial lining of the uterus. Acting with estrogen, progesterone promotes breast development and growth of endometrial cells during the menstrual cycle. It is believed that progestins may act by suppressing the production of estrogen from the adrenal glands (an alternate source particularly in post-menopausal women), lowering estrogen receptor levels, or altering tumour hormone metabolism.\nProgestin analogs are used in the management of uterine cancer (e.g. advanced uterine cancer) or renal cancer. They can also be used for treating advanced breast cancer, although this use is less common, due to the numerous anti-estrogen treatment options available. Occasionally, progestin analogs are used as hormonal therapy for prostate cancer. An example of a progestin analog is megestrol acetate (a.k.a. megestrel acetate), which has the chemical name 17\u03b1-acetyloxy-6-methylpregna-4,6-diene-3,20-dione, and is a putative inhibitor of pituitary gonadotrophin production with a resultant decrease in estrogen secretion, The drug is used for the palliative treatment of advanced carcinoma of the breast or endometrium (i.e., recurrent, inoperable, or metastatic disease), side-effects including oedema and thromoembolic episodes.\nPreferences and specific embodiments: A particularly preferred antiestrogen agent for use in accordance with the invention is tamoxifen.

Tamoxifen is advantageously administered orally in a dosage of 5 to 50 mg, preferably 10 to 20 mg twice a day (or 20 mg once a day), continuing the therapy for sufficient time to achieve and maintain a therapeutic effect.\nWith regard to the other preferred antiestrogen agents: fulvestrant is advantageously administered in the form of a 250 mg monthly injection (though doses of 250-750 mg per month may also be employed); toremifene is advantageously administered orally in a dosage of about 60 mg once a day, continuing the therapy for sufficient time to achieve and maintain a therapeutic effect; droloxifene is advantageously administered orally in a dosage of about 20-100 mg once a day; and raloxifene is advantageously administered orally in a dosage of about 60 mg once a day.\nWith regard to the preferred antiandrogen bicalutamide, this is generally administered in an oral dosage of 50 mg daily.\nWith regard to the preferred progestin analog megestrol/megestrel acetate, this is generally administered in an oral dosage of 40 mg four times daily.\nThe dosages noted above may generally be administered for example once, twice or more per course of treatment, which may be repeated for example daily or every 7, 14, 21 or 28 days in particular every 7, 14, 21 or 28 days.\nAromatase Inhibitors\nOf the hormones, hormone agonists, hormone antagonists and hormone modulating agents for use in the combinations of the invention, preferred are aromatase inhibitors.\nIn post-menopausal women, the principal source of circulating estrogen is from conversion of adrenal androgens (androstenedione and testosterone) to estrogens (estrone and estradiol) by the aromatase enzyme in peripheral tissues. Estrogen deprivation through aromatase inhibition or inactivation is an effective and selective treatment for some post-menopausal patients with hormone-dependent breast cancer. Examples of such hormone modulating agents include aromatase inhibitors or inactivators, such as exemestane, anastrozole, letrozole and aminoglutethimide.\nExemestane, which has the chemical name 6-methylenandrosta-1,4-diene-3,17-dione, is used for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in post-menopausal women whose disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy, side effects including hot flashes and nausea. Anastrozole, which has the chemical name, \u03b1,\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032,\u03b1\u2032-tetramethyl-5-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-benzenediacetonitrile, is used for adjuvant treatment of post-menopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer, and also for the first-line treatment of post-menopausal women with hormone receptor-positive or hormone receptor-unknown locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, and for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in post-menopausal women with disease progression following tamoxifen therapy. Administration of anastrozole usually results in side-effects including gastrointestinal disturbances, musculoskeletal pain, rashes and headaches. Letrozole, which has the chemical name 4,4\u2032-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethylene)-dibenzonitrile, is used for the adjuvant treatment of ER positive breast cancer, for first-line treatment of post-menopausal women with hormone receptor-positive or hormone receptor-unknown locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, and for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in post-menopausal women with disease progression following antiestrogen therapy, possible side-effects including occasional transient thrombocytopenia and elevation of liver transaminases.\nAminoglutethimide which has the chemical name 3-(4-aminophenyl)-3-ethyl-2,6-piperidinedione, is also used for treating breast cancer but suffers from the side-effects of skin rashes and less commonly thrombocytopenia and leukopenia.\nPreferred aromatase inhibitors include letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane and aminoglutethimide. Letrozole is commercially available for example from Novartis A.G. under the trade name Femara, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,978,672, or by processes analogous thereto. Anastrozole is commercially available for example from AstraZeneca plc under the trade name Arimidex, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,935,437, or by processes analogous thereto. Exemestane is commercially available for example from Pharmacia Corporation under the trade name Aromasin, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,978,672, or by processes analogous thereto. Aminoglutethimide is commercially available for example from Novartis A.G. under the trade name Cytadren, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,848,455, or by processes analogous thereto. The aromatase inhibitor vorozole, which may be prepared for example as described in European patent specification No. 293978, or by processes analogous thereto, can also be used in accordance with the invention.\nWith regard to the preferred aromatase inhihibitors, these are generally administered in an oral daily dosage in the range 1 to 1000 mg, for example letrozole in a dosage of about 2.5 mg once a day; anastrozole in a dosage of about 1 mg once a day; exemestane in a dosage of about 25 mg once a day; and aminoglutethimide in a dosage of 250 mg 2-4 times daily.\nParticularly preferred are aromatase inhibitors selected from the agents described herein, for example, letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane and aminoglutethimide.\nGNRAs\nOf the hormones, hormone agonists, hormone antagonists and hormone modulating agents for use in the combinations of the invention, preferred are agents of the GNRA class.\nDefinition: As used herein the term GNRA is intended to define gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists and antagonists (including those described below), together with the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.\nTechnical background: When released from the hypothalamus in the brain, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists stimulate the pituitary gland to produce gonadotropins. Gonadotropins are hormones that stimulate androgen synthesis in the testes and estrogen synthesis in the ovaries. When GnRH agonists are first administered, they can cause an increase in gonadotropin release, but with continued administration, GnRH will block gonadotropin release, and therefore decrease the synthesis of androgen and estrogen. GnRH analogs are used to treat metastatic prostate cancer. They have also been approved for treatment of metastatic breast cancer in pre-menopausal women. Examples of GnRH analogs include goserelin acetate and leuprolide acetate. In contrast GnRH antagonists such as aberelix cause no initial GnRH surge since they have no agonist effects. However, due to their narrow therapeutic index, their use is currently limited to advanced prostate cancer that is refractory to other hormonal treatment such as GnRH agonists and anti-androgens.\nGoserelin acetate is a synthetic decapeptide analog of LHRH or GnRH, and has the chemical structure of pyro-Glu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-D-Ser(Bu)-Leu-Arg-Pro-Azgly-NH2 acetate, and is used for the treatment of breast and prostate cancers and also endometriosis, side effects include hot flashes, bronchitis, arrhythmias, hypertension, anxiety and headaches. Leuprolide acetate is a synthetic nonapeptide analog of GnRH or LHRH, and has the chemical name 5-oxo-L-prolyl-L-histidyl-L-tryptophyl-L-seryl-L-tyrosyl-D-leucyl-L-leucyl-L-arginyl-N-ethyl-L-prolinamide acetate. Leuprolide acetate is used for the treatment of prostate cancer, endometriosis, and also breast cancer, side effects being similar to those of goserelin acetate.\nAbarelix is a synthetic decapeptide Ala-Phe-Ala-Ser-Tyr-Asn-Leu-Lys-Pro-Ala, and has the chemical name N-Acetyl-3-(2-naphthalenyl)-D-alanyl-4-chloro-D-phenylalanyl-3-(3-pyridinyl)-D-alanyl-L-seryl-N-methyl-L-tyrosyl-D-asparaginyl-L-leucyl-N6-(1-methylethyl)-L-lysyl-L-prolyl-D-alaninamide. Abarelix can be prepared according to R. W. Roeske, WO9640757 (1996 to Indiana Univ. Found.).\nPreferences and specific embodiments: Preferred GnRH agonists and antagonists for use in accordance with the invention include any of the GNRAs described herein, including in particular goserelin, leuprolide/leuporelin, triptorelin, buserelin, abarelix, goserelin acetate and leuprolide acetate. Particularly preferred are goserelin and leuprolide. Goserelin acetate is commercially available for example from AstraZeneca plc under the trade name Zoladex, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,510,460, or by processes analogous thereto. Leuprolide acetate is commercially available for example from TAP Pharmaceuticals Inc. under the trade name Lupron, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,914,412, or by processes analogous thereto. Goserelin is commercially available from AstraZeneca under the trade name Zoladex and may be prepared for example as described in ICI U.S. Pat. No. 4,100,274 or Hoechst patent publication EP475184 or by processes analagous thereto. Leuprolide is commercially available in the USA from TAP Pharmaceuticals Inc. under the trade name Lupron and in Europe from Wyeth under the trade name Prostap and may be prepared for example as described in Abbott U.S. Pat. No. 4,005,063 or by processes analogous thereto. Triptorelin is commercially available from Watson Pharma under the trade name Trelstar and may be prepared for example as described in Tulane U.S. Pat. No. 5,003,011 or by processes analagous thereto. Buserelin is commercially available under the trade name Suprefact and may be prepared for example as described in Hoechst U.S. Pat. No. 4,024,248 or by processes analogous thereto. Abarelix is commercially available from Praecis Pharmaceuticals (now part of GSK) under the trade name Plenaxis and may be prepared for example as described by Jiang et al., J Med Chem (2001), 44(3), 453-467 or Polypeptide Laboratories patent publication WO2003055900 or by processes analogous thereto.\nOther GnRH agonists and antagonists for use in accordance with the invention include, but are not limited to, Histrelin from Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp, Nafarelin acetate from Roche, and Deslorelin from Shire Pharmaceuticals.\nPosology: The GnRH agonists and antagonists are advantageously administered in dosages of 1.8 mg to 100 mg, for example 3.6 mg monthly or 10.8 mg every three months for goserelin or 7.5 mg monthly, 22.5 mg every three months or 30 mg every four months for leuprolide.\nWith regard to the preferred GnRH analogs, these are generally administered in the following dosages, namely goserelin acetate as a 3.6 mg subcutaneous implant every 4 weeks, and leuprolide as a 7.5 mg intramuscular depot every month.\n2. Cytokines and Cytokine-Activating Agents\nDefinition: The term \u201ccytokine\u201d is a term of art, and references to cytokines herein is intended to cover the cytokine per se together with the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above. The term \u201ccytokine-activating agent\u201d is intended to cover any agent which (directly or indirectly) induces, potentiates, stimulates, activates or promotes endogenous cytokine production or the activity thereof in vivo, together with the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.\nTechnical background: Cytokines are a class of proteins or polypeptides predominantly produced by cells of the immune system which have the capacity to control the function of a second cell. In relation to anticancer therapy cytokines are used to control the growth or kill the cancer cells directly and to modulate the immune system more effectively to control the growth of tumours.\nCytokines, such as interferon (IFN) alpha and Interleukin-2, induce growth arrest or tumour cell death. IFN-alpha is used the treatment of malignant melanoma, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), hairy cell leukemia, and Kaposi's sarcoma. Interleukin-2 is used in the treatment of malignant melanoma and renal cell cancer either alone or in combination with IFN-alpha.\nCytokines exhibit antitumour activity through a variety of different mechanisms including the stimulation of immune cells to fight tumors For example, the T cell growth factor, IL-2 promotes T-cell and natural killer (NK) cell activation. Other cytokines such as the interferons and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) act on antigen presenting cells to facilitate the activation of the key immune effector B cells and T cells.\nPreferences and specific embodiments: Any of the cytokines and cytokine-modulating agents described herein may find application in the invention, including in particular interferons (such as interferon-\u03b3 and interferon \u03b1) and interleukins (e.g. interleukin 2). Interferon \u03b1-2b (recombinant) is available commercially under the trade name of INTRON\u00ae A from Schering Plough.\nOther preferred interferons include Interferon \u03b1-2a which is available under the trade name of ROFERON from Roche.\nA particularly preferred interleukin is PROLEUKIN\u00ae IL-2 (aldesleukin) which is available from Chiron Corp.\nPosology: The interferons are administered by injection in a schedule which is dependent on the particular indication. For IntronA treatment of malignant melanoma preferably in a schedule that includes induction treatment on 5 consecutive days per week for 4 weeks as an intravenous (IV) infusion at a dose of 20 million IU/m2, followed by maintenance treatment three times per week for 48 weeks as a subcutaneous (SC) injection, at a dose of 10 million IU/m2. For Intron A treatment of non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma preferably in a schedule of 5 million IU subcutaneously three times per week for up to 18 months in conjunction with an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimen.\nThe recommended initial dose of Roferon-A for CML is 9 MIU daily administered as a subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. Based on clinical experience short-term tolerance may be improved by gradually increasing the dose of Roferon-A over the first week of administration from 3 MIU daily for 3 days to 6 MIU daily for 3 days to the target dose of 9 MIU daily for the duration of the treatment period. The induction dose of Roferon-A for Hairy cell leukaemia is 3 MIU daily for 16 to 24 weeks, administered as a subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. Subcutaneous administration is particularly suggested for, but not limited to, thrombocytopenic patients (platelet count <50,000) or for patients at risk for bleeding. The recommended maintenance dose is 3 MIU, three times a week (tiw).\nFor PROLEUKIN the following schedule has been used to treat adult patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (metastatic RCC) or metastatic melanoma (each course of treatment consists of two 5-day treatment cycles separated by a rest period): 600,000 IU/kg (0.037 mg/kg) dose administered every 8 hours by a 15-minute IV infusion for a maximum of 14 doses. Following 9 days of rest, the schedule is repeated for another 14 doses, for a maximum of 28 doses per course, as tolerated.\nCytokine-activating agents: Preferred cytokine-activating agents include: (a) Picibanil from Chugai Pharmaceuticals, an IFN-gamma-inducing molecule for carcinoma treatment; (b) Romurtide from Daiichi which activates the cytokine network by stimulation of colony stimulating factor release; (c) Sizofuran from Kaken Pharmaceutical, a beta1-3, beta1-6 D-glucan isolated from suchirotake mushroom, which stimulates production of IFN-gamma and IL-2 by mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and is useful in uterine cervix tumour and lung tumour treatment; (d) Virulizin from Lorus Therapeutics Inc, a NK agonist and cytokine release modulator which stimulates IL-17 synthesis and IL-12 release for the treatment of sarcoma, melanoma, pancreas tumours, breast tumours, lung tumours, and Kaposis sarcoma (e) Thymosin alpha 1, a synthetic 28-amino acid peptide with multiple biological activities primarily directed towards immune response enhancement for increased production of Th1 cytokines, which is useful in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma, carcinoma, and lung brain and renal tumours.\n3. Retinoids and Rexinoids\nDefinition: The term \u201cretinoid\u201d is a term of art used herein in a broad sense to include not only the specific retinoids disclosed herein, but also the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above. The term \u2018rexinoids\u2019 refers to synthetic agents that bind specifically to retinoid X receptors.\nTechnical background: Tretinoin is an endogenous metabolite of retinol. It induces terminal differentiation in several hemopoietic precursor cell lines, including human myeloid cell lines. Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) is associated with a specific translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17; the retinoic acid receptor-\u03b1 is located on chromosome 17. The translocation appears to inhibit differentiation and lead to carcinogenesis; tretinoin may overcome this when used in high doses. Tretinoin induces remissions in 64-100% of APL patients, with time to remission usually between 8 and 119 days of therapy. Acquired resistance during therapy is common especially with prolonged dosing (4-6 months). Alitretinoin is a 9-cis-retinoic acid derivative which appears to be selective for the RXR subfamily of retinoid receptors. This selectivity may preserve therapeutic antineoplastic effects while reducing significant side effects of retinoid therapy including birth defects at fetal exposure, irritation of skin and mucosal surfaces or skeletal abnormalities. Topical alitretinoin is approved in the US for the treatment of Kaposi's Sarcoma. Oral and gel (topical) formulations of bexarotene (Targretin; LGD-1069), a retinoid X receptor (RXR)-selective antitumor retinoid, are available for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).\nU.S. Pat. No. 6,127,382, WO 01/70668, WO 00/68191, WO 97/48672, WO 97/19052 and WO 97/19062 (all to Allergan) each describe compounds having retinoid-like activity for use in the treatment of various hyperproliferative diseases including cancers.\nPreferences and specific embodiments: Preferred retinoids for use in accordance with the invention include any of the retinoids disclosed herein, including in particular tretinoin (all-trans retinoic acid), alitretinoin and bexarotene. Tretinoin (Retacnyl, Aknoten, Tretin M) is commercially available from Roche under the trade name Vesanoid and may be prepared for example as described in D. A. van Dorp, J. R. Arens, Rec. Tray. Chim. 65, 338 (1946); C. D. Robeson et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 77, 4111 (1955); R. Marbet, DE 2061507; U.S. Pat. No. 3,746,730 (1971, 1973 both to Hoffmann-La Roche), or by processes analogous thereto. Alitretinoin (9-cis-Tretinoin, Panrexin) is commercially available from Ligand Pharmaceuticals under the trade name Panretin and may be prepared for example as described in C. D. Robeson et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 77, 4111 (1955); M. Matsui et al., J. Vitaminol. 4, 178 (1958); M. F. Boehm et al., J. Med. Chem. 37, 408 (1994), or by processes analogous thereto. Bexarotene (Targrexin, Targret) is commercially available from Eisai Inc under the trade name Targretin and may be prepared for example as described in M. F. Boehm et al., WO 9321146 (1993 to Ligand Pharm.); M. L. Dawson et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,466,861 (1995 to SRI Int.; La Jolla Cancer Res.

Bexarotene gel is advantageously applied initially once every other day for the first week. The application frequency may be increased at weekly intervals to once daily, then twice daily, then three times daily and finally four times daily according to individual lesion tolerance.\n4. Monoclonal Antibodies.\nAny monoclonal antibody e.g. including but not limited to one or more cell surface antigen(s) may be used in the combinations of the invention. Antibody specificity may be assayed or determined using any of a wide variety of techniques well-known to those skilled in the art.\nDefinition: The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d used herein refers to antibodies from any source, and so includes those that are fully human and also those which contain structural or specificity determining elements derived from other species (and which can be referred to as, for example, chimeric or humanized antibodies).\nTechnical background: The use of monoclonal antibodies is now widely accepted in anticancer chemotherapy as they are highly specific and can therefore bind and affect disease specific targets, thereby sparing normal cells and causing fewer side-effects than traditional chemotherapies.\nOne group of cells which have been investigated as targets for antibody chemotherapy for the treatment of various cancers are those bearing the cell-surface antigens comprising the cluster designation (CD) molecules which are over-expressed or aberrantly expressed in tumour cells, for example CD20, CD22, CD33 and CD52 which are over-expressed on the tumour cell surface, most notably in tumours of hematopoietic origin. Antibodies to these CD targets (anti-CD antibodies) include the monoclonal antibodies rituximab (a.k.a. rituxamab), tositumomab and gemtuzumab ozogamicin.\nRituximab/rituxamab is a mouse/human chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody which has been used extensively for the treatment of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma including relapsed, refractory low-grade or follicular lymphoma. The product is also being developed for various other indications including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and rheumatoid arthritis. Side effects of rituximab/rituxamab may include hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation or cardiogenic shock. Tositumomab is a cell-specific anti-CD20 antibody labelled with iodine-131, for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and lymphocytic leukaemia. Possible side-effects of tositumomab include thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is a cytotoxic drug (calicheamicin) linked to a human monoclonal antibody specific for CD33. Calicheamicin is a very potent antitumour agent, over 1,000 times more potent than adriamycin. Once released inside the cell, calicheamicin binds in a sequence-specific manner to the minor groove of DNA, undergoes rearrangement, and exposes free radicals, leading to breakage of double-stranded DNA, and resulting in cell apoptosis (programmed cell death). Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is used as a second-line treatment for acute myeloid leukaemia, possible side-effects including severe hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis, and also hepatotoxicity.\nAlemtuzumab (Millennium Pharmaceuticals, also known as Campath) is a humanized monoclonal antibody against CD52 useful for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma which induces the secretion of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL-6.\nPreferences: Preferred monoclonal antibodies for use according to the invention include anti-CD antibodies, including alemtuzumab, CD20, CD22 and CD33. Particularly preferred are monoclonal antibody to cell surface antigens, including anti-CD antibodies (for example, CD20, CD22, CD33) as described above. Other preferred monoclonal antibodies include those which target interleukin 6 (IL-6).\nSpecific embodiments: In one embodiment, the monoclonal antibody is an antibody to the cluster designation CD molecules, for example, CD20, CD22, CD33 and CD52. In another embodiment, the monoclonal antibody to cell surface antigen is selected from rituximab/rituxamab, tositumomab and gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Other monoclonal antibodies that may be used according to the invention include bevacizumab.\nExemplary formulations: Monoclonal antibodies to cell surface antigen(s) for use according to the invention include CD52 antibodies (e.g. alemtuzumab) and other anti-CD antibodies (for example, CD20, CD22 and CD33), as described herein. Preferred are therapeutic combinations comprising a monoclonal antibody to cell surface antigen(s), for example anti-CD antibodies (e.g. CD20, CD22 and CD33) which exhibit an advantageous efficacious effect, for example, against tumour cell growth, in comparison with the respective effects shown by the individual components of the combination.\nCD52 selectivity has also been achieved through the combination of a specific ligand with diphtheria toxin which is released intracellularly (denileukin difitox; Ontak). This approach has been licensed for use in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and is under investigation for the treatment of other types of non-hodgkin's lymphoma.\nIn addition targeting structures other than tumour cells themselves have also been shown to be efficacious in cancer therapy. This approach has been most effective in inhibiting new blood vessel formation using bevacuzimab, a monoclonal antibody directed against circulating Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor. This approach may be useful in the treatment of a wide range of malignancies.\nPreferred examples of monoclonal antibodies to cell surface antigens (anti-CD antibodies) include rituximab/rituxamab, tositumomab and gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Rituximab/rituxamab is commercially available from F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd under the trade name Mabthera, or may be obtained as described in PCT patent specification No. WO 94/11026. Tositumomab is commercially available from GlaxoSmithKline plc under the trade name Bexxar, or may be obtained as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,595,721. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is commercially available from Wyeth Research under the trade name Mylotarg, or may be obtained as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,877,296.\nBiological activity: Monoclonal antibodies (e.g. monoclonal antibodies to one or more cell surface antigen(s)) have been identified as suitable anti-cancer agents. Antibodies are effective through a variety of mechanisms. They can block essential cellular growth factors or receptors, directly induce apoptosis, bind to target cells or deliver cytotoxic payloads such as radioisotopes and toxins.\nPosology: The anti-CD antibodies may be administered for example in dosages of 5 to 400 mg per square meter (mg/m2) of body surface; in particular gemtuzumab ozogamicin may be administered for example in a dosage of about 9 mg/m2 of body surface; rituximab/rituxamab may be administered for example in a dosage of about 375 mg/m2 as an IV infusion once a week for four doses; the dosage for tositumomab must be individually quantified for each patient according to the usual clinical parameters such as age, weight, sex and condition of the patient to ensure appropriate delivery of the radioisotope.\nThese dosages may be administered for example once, twice or more per course of treatment, which may be repeated for example every 7, 14, 21 or 28 days.\n5. Camptothecin Compounds\nDefinition: The term \u201ccamptothecin compound\u201d as used herein refers to camptothecin per se or analogues of camptothecin as described herein, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.\nTechnical background: Camptothecin compounds are compounds related to or derived from the parent compound camptothecin which is a water-insoluble alkaloid derived from the Chinese tree Camptothecin acuminata and the Indian tree Nothapodytes foetida. Camptothecin has a potent inhibitory activity against DNA biosynthesis and has shown high activity against tumour cell growth in various experimental systems. Its clinical use in anti-cancer therapy is, however, limited significantly by its high toxicity, and various analogues have been developed in attempts to reduce the toxicity of camptothecin while retaining the potency of its anti-tumour effect. Examples of such analogues include irinotecan and topotecan.\nThese compounds have been found to be specific inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase I. Topoisomerases are enzymes that are capable of altering DNA topology in eukaryotic cells. They are critical for important cellular functions and cell proliferation. There are two classes of topoisomerases in eukaryotic cells, namely type I and type II. Topoisomerase I is a monomeric enzyme having a molecular weight of approximately 100,000. The enzyme binds to DNA and introduces a transient single-strand break, unwinds the double helix (or allows it to unwind) and subsequently reseals the break before dissociating from the DNA strand.\nIrinotecan, namely 7-ethyl-10-(4-(1-piperidino)-1-piperidino)carbonyloxy-(20S)-camptothecin, and its hydrochloride, also known as CPT 11, have been found to have improved potency and reduced toxicity, and superior water-solubility. Irinotecan has been found to have clinical efficacy in the treatment of various cancers especially colorectal cancer. Another important camptothecin compound is topotecan, namely (S)-9-dimethylaminomethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin which, in clinical trials, has shown efficacy against several solid tumours, particularly ovarian and cervical cancer and small cell lung cancer or alternatively ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma.\nExemplary formulations: A parenteral pharmaceutical formulation for administration by injection and containing a camptothecin compound can be prepared by dissolving 100 mg of a water soluble salt of the camptothecin compound (for example a compound as described in EP 0321122 and in particular the examples therein) in 10 ml of sterile 0.9% saline and then sterilising the solution and filling the solution into a suitable container.\nBiological activity: The camptothecin compounds of the combinations of the invention are specific inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase I are described above and have activity against various cancers.\nPrior art references: WO 01/64194 (Janssen) discloses combinations of farnesyl transferase inhibitors and camptothecin compounds. EP 137145 (Rhone Poulenc Rorer) discloses camptothecin compounds including irinotecan. EP 321122 (SmithKline Beecham) discloses camptothecin compounds including topotecan.\nProblems: Although camptothecin compounds are widely used as chemotherapeutic agents in humans, they are not therapeutically effective in all patients or against all types of tumours. There is therefore a need to increase the inhibitory efficacy of camptothecin compounds against tumour growth and also to provide a means for the use of lower dosages of camptothecin compounds to reduce the potential for adverse toxic side effects to the patient.\nPreferences: Preferred camptothecin compounds for use in accordance with the invention include irinotecan and topotecan referred to above. Irinotecan is commercially available for example from Rhone-Poulenc Rorer under the trade name \u201cCampto\u201d and may be prepared for example as described in European patent specification No. 137145 or by processes analogous thereto. Topotecan is commercially available for example from SmithKline Beecham under the trade name \u201cHycamtin\u201d and may be prepared for example as described in European patent number 321122 or by processes analogous thereto. Other camptothecin compounds may be prepared in conventional manner for example by processes analogous to those described above for irinotecan and topotecan.\nSpecific embodiments: In one embodiment, the camptothecin compound is irinotecan. In another embodiment, the camptothecin compound is a camptothecin compound other than irinotecan, for example a camptothecin compound such as topotecan.\nPosology: The camptothecin compound is advantageously administered in a dosage of 0.1 to 400 mg per square metre (mg/m2) of body surface area, for example 1 to 300 mg/m2, particularly for irinotecan in a dosage of about 100 to 350 mg/m2 and for topotecan in about 1 to 2 mg/m2 per course of treatment. These dosages may be administered for example once, twice or more per course of treatment, which may be repeated daily or every 7, 14, 21 or 28 days in particular every 7, 14, 21 or 28 days.\n6. Antimetabolites\nDefinition: The terms \u201cantimetabolic compound\u201d and \u201cantimetabolite\u201d are used as synonyms and define antimetabolic compounds or analogues of antimetabolic compounds as described herein, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above. Thus, the antimetabolic compounds, otherwise known as antimetabolites, referred to herein constitute a large group of anticancer drugs that interfere with metabolic processes vital to the physiology and proliferation of cancer cells. Such compounds include nucleoside derivatives, either pyrimidine or purine nucleoside analogs, that inhibit DNA synthesis, and inhibitors of thymidylate synthase and/or dihydrofolate reductase enzymes.\nTechnical background: Antimetabolites (or antimetabolic compounds), constitute a large group of anticancer drugs that interfere with metabolic processes vital to the physiology and proliferation of cancer cells. Such compounds include nucleoside derivatives, either pyrimidine or purine nucleoside analogues, that inhibit DNA synthesis, and inhibitors of thymidylate synthase and/or dihydrofolate reductase enzymes. Anti-tumour nucleoside derivatives have been used for many years for the treatment of various cancers. Among the oldest and most widely used of these derivatives is 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) which has been used to treat a number of cancers such as colorectal, breast, hepatic and head and neck tumours.\nIn order to enhance the cytotoxic effect of 5-FU, leucovorin has been used to stabilise the resulting thymidylate synthase/5-FU complex thus further increasing its inhibitor. However, various factors limit the use of 5-FU, for example tumour resistance, toxicities, including gastrointestinal and haematological effects, and the need for intravenous administration. Various approaches have been taken to overcome these disadvantages including proposals to overcome the poor bioavailability of 5-FU and also to increase the therapeutic index of 5-FU, either by reducing systemic toxicity or by increasing the amount of active drug reaching the tumour.\nOne such compound which provides an improved therapeutic advantage over 5-FU is capecitabine, which has the chemical name [1-(5-deoxy-\u03b2-D-ribofuranosyl)-5-fluoro-1,2-dihydro-2-oxo-4-pyrimidinyl]-carbamic acid pentyl ester. Capecitabine is a pro-drug of 5-FU which is well absorbed after oral dosing and delivers pharmacologically-active concentrations of 5-FU to tumours. As well as offering potentially superior activity to 5-FU, it can also be used for oral therapy with prolonged administration.\nGemcitabine is a nucleoside analogue which has the chemical name 2\u2032-deoxy-2\u2032,2\u2032-difluoro-cytidine, and which has been used in the treatment of various cancers including non-small cell lung cancer, breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancer in particular non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. Further anti-tumour nucleosides include cytarabine and fludarabine. Cytarabine, also known as ara-C, which has the chemical name 1-\u03b2-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, has been found useful in the treatment of acute leukemia, chronic myelocytic leukemia and erythroleukemia. Cytarabine, also known as ara-C, which has the chemical name 1-\u03b2-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, has been found useful in the treatment of acute myelocytic leukemia, chronic myelocytic leukemia (blast phase), acute lymphocytic leukemia and erythroleukemia. Fludarabine is a DNA synthesis inhibitor, which has the chemical name 9-\u03b2-D-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoro-adenine, and is used for the treatment of refractory B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Other anti-folate antimetabolites used in anticancer chemotherapy include the enzyme inhibitors raltitrexed, pemetrexed, and methotrexate. Raltitrexed is a folate-based thymidylate synthase inhibitor, which has the chemical name N-[5-[N-[(3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxo-6-quinazolinyl)-methyl-N-methylamino]-2-thenoyl]-L-glutamic acid, and is used in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer. Pemetrexed is a thymidylate synthase and transferase inhibitor, which has the chemical name N-[4-[2-(2-amino-4,7-dihydro-4-oxo-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)ethyl]benzoyl]-L-glutamic acid, disodium salt, and is used for the treatment of mesothelioma and locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) in previously treated patients. Methotrexate is an antimetabolite which interrupts cell division by inhibiting DNA replication through dihydrofolate reductase inhibition, resulting in cell death, and has the chemical name is N-[4-[[(2,4-diamino-6-pteridinyl)methyl]-ethylamino]benzoyl]-L-glutamic acid, and is used for the treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia, and also in the treatment of breast cancer, epidermoid cancers of the head and neck, and lung cancer, particularly squamous cell and small cell types, and advanced stage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, in particular in the treatment of breast cancer, epidermoid cancers of the head and neck, and advanced stage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.\nBiological activity: The antimetabolic compounds of the combinations of the invention interfere with metabolic processes vital to the physiology and proliferation of cancer cells as described above and have activity against various cancers.\nProblems: These anticancer agents have a number of side-effects especially myelosuppression and in some cases nausea and diarrhoea. There is therefore a need to provide a means for the use of lower dosages to reduce the potential of adverse toxic side effects to the patient.\nPreferences: Preferred antimetabolic compounds for use in accordance with the invention include anti-tumour nucleosides such as 5-fluorouracil, gemcitabine, capecitabine, cytarabine and fludarabine and enzyme inhibitors such as ralitrexed, pemetrexed and methotrexate referred to herein. Thus, preferred antimetabolic compounds for use in accordance with the invention are anti-tumour nucleoside derivatives including 5-fluorouracil, gemcitabine, capecitabine, cytarabine and fludarabine referred to herein. Other preferred antimetabolic compounds for use in accordance with the invention are enzyme inhibitors including ralitrexed, pemetrexed and methotrexate.\n5-Fluorouracil is widely available commercially, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. patent specification No. 2802005. Gemcitabine is commercially available for example from Eli Lilly and Company under the trade name Gemzar, or may be prepared for example as described in European patent specification No. 122707, or by processes analogous thereto. Capecitabine is commercially available for example from Hoffman-La Roche Inc under the trade name Xeloda, or may be prepared for example as described in European patent specification No. 698611, or by processes analogous thereto. Cytarabine is commercially available for example from Pharmacia and Upjohn Co under the trade name Cytosar, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,116,282, or by processes analogous thereto. Fludarabine is commercially available for example from Schering AG under the trade name Fludara, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,357,324, or by processes analogous thereto. Ralitrexed is commercially available for example from AstraZeneca plc under the trade name Tomudex, or may be prepared for example as described in European patent specification No. 239632, or by processes analogous thereto. Pemetrexed is commercially available for example from Eli Lilly and Company under the trade name Alimta, or may be prepared for example as described in European patent specification No. 432677, or by processes analogous thereto. Methotrexate is commercially available for example from Lederle Laboraories under the trade name Methotrexate-Lederle, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,512,572, or by processes analogous thereto. Other antimetabolites for use in the combinations of the invention include 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, cladribine, 2\u2032-deoxycoformycin and hydroxyurea.\nSpecific embodiments: In one embodiment, the antimetabolic compound is gemcitabine. In another embodiment, the antimetabolic compound is a antimetabolic compound other than 5-fluorouracil or fludarabine, for example an antimetabolic compound such as gemcitabine, capecitabine, cytarabine, ralitrexed, pemetrexed or methotrexate.\nPosology: The antimetabolite compound will be administered in a dosage that will depend on the factors noted above. Examples of dosages for particular preferred antimetabolites are given below by way of example. With regard to anti-tumour nucleosides, these are advantageously administered in a daily dosage of 10 to 2500 mg per square meter (mg/m2) of body surface area, for example 700 to 1500 mg/m2, particularly for 5-FU in a dosage of 200 to 500 mg/m2, for gemcitabine in a dosage of 800 to 1200 mg/m2, for capecitabine in a dosage of 1000 to 1200 mg/m2, for cytarabine in a dosage of 100-200 mg/m2 and for fludarabine in a dosage of 10 to 50 mg/m2.\nFor the following enzyme inhibitors, examples are given of possible doses. Thus, raltitrexed can be administered in a dosage of about 3 mg/m2, pemetrexed in a dosage of 500 mg/m2 and methotrexate in a dosage of 30-40 mg/m2.\nThe dosages noted above may generally be administered for example once, twice or more per course of treatment, which may be repeated for example every 7, 14, 21 or 28 days.\n7. Vinca Alkaloids\nDefinition: The term \u201cvinca alkaloid\u201d as used herein refers to vinca alkaloid compounds or analogues of vinca alkaloid compounds as described herein, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.\nTechnical background: The vinca alkaloids for use in the combinations of the invention are anti-tumour vinca alkaloids related to or derived from extracts of the periwinkle plant (Vinca rosea). Among these compounds, vinblastine and vincristine are important clinical agents for the treatment of leukaemias, lymphomas and testicular cancer, and vinorelbine has activity against lung cancer and breast cancer.\nBiological activity: The vinca alkaloid compounds of the combinations of the invention are tubulin targeting agents and have activity against various cancers.\nProblems: Treatment with Vinca alkaloids is accompanied by significant toxicities. For example, vinblastine causes leukopenia which reaches a nadir in 7 to 10 days following drug administration, after which recovery ensues within 7 days, while vincristine demonstrates some neurological toxicity for example numbness and trembling of the extremities, loss of deep tendon reflexes and weakness of distal limb musculature. Vinorelbine has some toxicity in the form of granulocytopenia but with only modest thrombocytopenia and less neurotoxicity than other vinca alkaloids. There is therefore a need to increase the inhibitory efficacy of anti-tumour vinca alkaloids against tumour growth and also to provide a means for the use of lower dosages of anti-tumour vinca alkaloids to reduce the potential of adverse toxic side effects to the patient.\nPreferences: Preferred anti-tumour vinca alkaloids for use in accordance with the invention include vindesine, vinvesir, vinblastine, vincristine and vinorelbine. Particularly preferred anti-tumour vinca alkaloids for use in accordance with the invention include vinblastine, vincristine and vinorelbine referred to above. Vinblastine is commercially available for example as the sulphate salt for injection from Eli Lilly and Co under the trade name Velban, and may be prepared for example as described in German patent specification No. 2124023 or by processes analogous thereto. Vincristine is commercially available for example as the sulphate salt for injection from Eli Lilly and Co under the trade name Oncovin and may be prepared for example as described in the above German patent specification No. 2124023 or by processes analogous thereto. Vincristine is also available as a liposomal formulation under the name Onco-TCS\u2122. Vinorelbine is commercially available for example as the tartrate salt for injection from Glaxo Wellcome under the trade name Navelbine and may be prepared for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,307,100, or by processes analogous thereto. Other anti-tumour vinca alkaloids may be prepared in conventional manner for example by processes analogous to those described above for vinoblastine, vincristine and vinorelbine.\nAnother preferred vinca alkaloid is vindesine. Vindesine is a synthetic derivative of the dimeric catharanthus alkaloid vinblastine, is available from Lilly under the tradename Eldisine and from Shionogi under the tradename Fildesin. Details of the synthesis of Vindesine are described in Lilly patent DE2415980 (1974) and by C. J. Burnett et al., J. Med. Chem. 21, 88 (1978).\nSpecific embodiments: In one embodiment, the vinca alkaloid compound is selected from vinoblastine, vincristine and vinorelbine. In another embodiment, the vinca alkaloid compound is vinoblastine.\nPosology: The anti-tumour vinca alkaloid is advantageously administered in a dosage of 2 to 30 mg per square meter (mg/m2) of body surface area, particularly for vinblastine in a dosage of about 3 to 12 mg/m2, for vincristine in a dosage of about 1 to 2 mg/m2, and for vinorelbine in dosage of about 10 to 30 mg/m2 per course of treatment. These dosages may be administered for example once, twice or more per course of treatment, which may be repeated for example every 1, 14, 21 or 28 days.\n8. Taxanes (Taxoids)\nDefinition: The term \u201ctaxane compound\u201d as used herein refers to taxane compounds or analogues of taxane compounds as described herein, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.\nTechnical background: The taxanes are a class of compounds having the taxane ring system and related to or derived from extracts from certain species of yew (Taxus) trees. These compounds have been found to have activity against tumour cell growth and certain compounds in this class have been used in the clinic for the treatment of various cancers. Thus, for example, paclitaxel is a diterpene isolated from the bark of the yew tree, Taxus brevifolia, and can be produced by partial synthesis from 10-acetylbacctin, a precursor obtained from yew needles and twigs or by total synthesis, see Holton et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 116; 1597-1601 (1994) and Nicholau et al, Nature 367:630 (1994). Paclitaxel has shown anti-neoplastic activity and more recently it has been established that its antitumour activity is due to the promotion of microtubule polymerisation, Kumar N. J., Biol. Chem. 256: 1035-1041 (1981); Rowinsky et al, J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 82: 1247-1259 (1990); and Schiff et al, Nature 277: 655-667 (1979). Paclitaxel has now demonstrated efficacy in several human tumours in clinical trials, McGuire et al, Ann. Int. Med., 111:273-279 (1989); Holmes et al, J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 83: 1797-1805 (1991); Kohn et al J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 86: 18-24 (1994); and Kohn et al, American Society for Clinical Oncology, 12 (1993). Paclitaxel is used for the treatment of ovarian, breast and lung cancer, in particular has for example been used for the treatment of ovarian cancer and also breast cancer.\nMore recently a nanomolar formulation of paclitaxel complexed with albumin has been shown to be at least as efficacious and less myelosuppressive than paclitaxel alone. (APP; Abraxane). Paclitaxel mconjugates with glutamic acid are also in development.\nAnother taxane compound which has been used in the clinic is docetaxel which has been shown to have particular efficacy in the treatment of advanced breast cancer. Docetaxel has shown a better solubility in excipient systems than paclitaxel, therefore increasing the ease with which it can be handled and used in pharmaceutical compositions.\nBiological activity: The taxane compounds of the combinations of the invention are tubulin targeting agents and have activity against various cancers.\nProblems: Clinical use of taxanes has demonstrated a narrow therapeutic index with many patients unable to tolerate the side effects associated with its use. There is therefore a need to increase the inhibitory efficacy of taxane compounds against tumour growth and also to provide a means for the use of lower dosages of taxane compounds to reduce the potential of adverse toxic side effects to the patient. The development of taxanes with increased solubility in aqueous solutions would also be desirable.\nPreferences: Preferred taxane compounds for use in accordance with the invention include paclitaxel Abraxane or docetaxel referred to herein. Paclitaxel is available commercially for example under the trade name Taxol from Bristol Myers Squibb and docetaxel is available commercially under the trade name Taxotere from Sanofi-Aventis (previously Rhone-Poulenc Rorer). Both compounds and other taxane compounds may be prepared in conventional manner for example as described in EP 253738, EP 253739 and WO 92/09589 or by processes analogous thereto.\nSpecific embodiments: In one embodiment, the taxane compound is paclitaxel. In another embodiment, the taxane compound is docetaxel.\nPosology: The taxane compound is advantageously administered in a dosage of 50 to 400 mg per square meter (mg/m2) of body surface area, for example 75 to 250 mg/m2, particularly for paclitaxel in a dosage of about 175 to 250 mg/m2 and for docetaxel in about 75 to 150 mg/m2 per course of treatment. These dosages may be administered for example once, twice or more per course of treatment, which may be repeated for example every 7, 14, 21 or 28 days.\n9. Epothilones\nDefinition: As used herein, the term \u201cepothilone\u201d is used to define a class of cytotoxic macrolides with a similar mechanism of action to paclitaxel but with the potential advantage of activity in taxane-resistant settings in preclinical models. The epothilones ixabepilone, patupilone, BMS-310705, KOS-862 and ZK-EPO are in early clinical trials for cancer treatment. Phase I studies have shown that dose-limiting toxicities of epothilones are generally neurotoxicity and neutropenia although initial studies with patupilone indicated that diarrhoea was dose limiting. Neuropathy induced by ixabepilone may be schedule dependent. Response rates in taxane-refractory metastatic breast cancer are relatively modest, but ixabepilone and patupilone have shown promising efficacy in hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer and in taxane-refractory ovarian cancer.\nTechnical Background; Epothilones A and B were originally isolated as anti-fungal fermentation products of the myxobacteria Sorangium cellulosum. Shortly thereafter these agents were demonstrated to stabilize microtubules and induce mitotic arrest. Though their cytotoxic activity relies on the same mechanism as that of the taxanes, the epothilones have a couple of key advantages. Firstly they are not substrates for the multi-drug resistance pump P-gylycoprotein. Secondly they are easier both to produce (because of their bacterial origin) and to manipulate. Chemical syntheses, either total or partial, of these molecules and their analogs allows for modification to enhance their efficacy Mani et al. Anticancer Drugs 2004; 15(6):553-8). Several epothilones or epothilone-derivatives have been shown effective against cell lines and tumor xenografts and are now in clinical trials (Goodin et al. J Clin Oncol 2004; 22(10): 2015-25). An unexpected source for the identification of microtubule stabilizing agents has been marine organisms. Laulimalide and isolaulimalide are natural products of the marine sponge Cacospongia mycofijiensis with strong paclitaxel-like activity, even against P-gp expressing cell lines. Eluetherobin, similar in both respects, is a product of the Eleutherobia species of soft coral.\nBiological Activity; Formation of microtubules involves polymerization of heterodimeric \u03b1/\u03b2-tubulin subunits with multiple isoforms of both \u03b1- and \u03b2-tubulin present in human cells. Intact microtubule function is required for formation and functioning of the mitotic spindle, and cells treated with agents that bind either tubulin subunits or polymerized microtubules exhibit alterations in spindle formation, as well as arrest at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, which is associated with induction of apoptosis. Compounds that target microtubules are potent cytotoxic agents, exemplified by the convergent evolution of microtubule-targeting compounds by a variety of plant and marine species. Published studies of three epothilones in current clinical development, epothilone B, aza-epothilone B, and desoxyepothilone B, indicate that these compounds exhibit broad spectrum antitumor activity in cell culture models and in xenografts. Furthermore, epothilones are generally more cytotoxic than paclitaxel in cell culture studies, with IC50 values in the sub- or low nanomolar range in a variety of tumor cell lines (Bollag et al. Cancer Res 55:2325-2333, 1995; Lee et al. Clin Cancer Res 7:1429-1437, 2001; Chou et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 95:9642-9647, 1998; Newman et al. Cancer Chemother Pharmacol 48:319-326, 2001). Preclinical studies also demonstrated important differences with regard to drug resistance mechanisms between epothilones and taxanes. In particular, overexpression of P-glycoprotein minimally affects the cytotoxicity of epothilone B, aza-epothilone B, and desoxyepothilones in cell culture models. Comparison of the cytotoxic effects of epothilone B, aza-epothilone B, and desoxyepothilone B among P-glycoprotein-overexpressing cell lines suggests that desoxyepothilone B is least affected, whereas aza-epothilone B is most affected by P-glycoprotein expression. However, it should be noted that differences among the IC50s of these compounds in P-glycoprotein-overexpressing cell lines are small compared with the differences between these values and IC50s for paclitaxel in these cell lines. Although the significance of P-glycoprotein expression in clinical resistance to taxanes remains uncertain, these results suggest that epothilones may be more active than taxanes in patients with malignancies characterized by high levels of P-glycoprotein expression. In vivo studies indicate that epothilones are active in paclitaxel-sensitive and -resistant tumor models using a variety of schedules. When administered intravenously to mice using intermittent daily or weekly schedules, aza-epothilone B is highly active in ovarian, colon, and breast xenografts and induces cures in an ovarian xenograft model (Pat-7) that is resistant to paclitaxel. Notably, unlike paclitaxel, aza-epothilone B is effective when administered orally in preclinical models. This phenomenon likely relates to the expression of P-glycoprotein in intestinal mucosa, resulting in poor absorption of paclitaxel but not epothilones.\nProblems; Sensory neuropathy and myelosuppression has been documented with epothilones\nPreferences; Existing structure-activity data provide some insight into the interaction between epothilones and microtubules. Results from several groups indicate that modifications at or near the C12-13 epoxide can affect microtubule-stabilizing activity (Wartmann and Altmann, Curr Med Chem Anti-Canc Agents 2:123-148, 2002). For example, addition of a methyl group to epothilone A at position C12 yields epothilone B, which is approximately twice as potent as epothilone A or paclitaxel in inducing tubulin polymerization in vitro (Kowalski et al. J Biol Chem 272: 2534-2541, 1997; Nicolaou et al. Nature 387:268-272, 1997, abstr 428). In addition, it is clear that an epoxide at C12-13 is not required for microtubule-binding, because desoxyepothilone B (also known as epothilone D or KOS-862) lacks the C12-13 epoxide and is a more potent microtubule stabilizer in vitro than epothilone A or B. Less data are available regarding the effects of modifying other regions of epothilone. Despite attempts to improve microtubule binding by altering the C9-C12 region (on the basis of molecular modeling), alterations in this area resulted in loss of cytotoxic activity. By contrast, replacement of the lactone oxygen of epothilone B with a lactam (aza-epothilone B, also known as BMS-247550) does not impair microtubule-polymerizing activity or cytotoxicity. Although a variety of other epothilone analogs have been synthesized, it should be noted that increasing microtubule-stabilizing activity does not always result in increased cytotoxicity, presumably because of the importance of other variables such as cellular accumulation and metabolic stability (Wartmann and Altmann, Curr Med Chem Anti-Canc Agents 2:123-148, 2002). Indeed, replacement of the methyl group at C12 position of desoxyepothilone B with a propanol group results in a compound that is as effective as desoxyepothilone B against the leukemic cell line CCRF-CEM but is significantly less active against a P-glycoprotein-overexpressing subline (IC50 of 17 nmol/L for desoxyepothilone B v 167 nmol/L for the propanol derivative) (Chou et al. Proc Natl Aced Sci USA 95:9642-9647, 1998). Additional modifications of naturally occurring epothilones have been made in an effort to improve solubility, such as BMS-310705, which is a C-21-substituted derivative of epothilone B (Lee et al. Proc Am Assoc Cancer Res 43:a3928, 2002).\nSpecific embodiments: In one embodiment, the epothilone compound is BMS-247550. In another embodiment, the epothilone compound is Desoxyeopthilone and in another embodiment the epothilone compound is BMS-310705\nPosology: BMS-247550 is dosed either 40 mg/m2 over 3 hours every 21 days or 6 mg/m2 administered over 1 hour daily times 5 days every 3 weeks. Because of the frequency of mucositis and neutropenia in the first 18 patients on the single-dose every-3-week schedule, the dose was reduced to 32 mg/m2. EP0906 is dosed either at 2.5 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks followed by 1 week of rest in one trial, and 6 mg/m2 once every 3 weeks. KOS-862 is scheduled at either a single dose every 3 weeks, a daily dose times 3 every 3 weeks, a fixed rate dose every 3 weeks, and a weekly dose for 3 weeks with 1 week rest.\n10. Platinum Compounds\nDefinition: The term \u201cplatinum compounds\u201d as used herein refers to any tumour cell growth inhibiting platinum compound including platinum coordination compounds, compounds which provide platinum in the form of an ion and analogues of platinum compounds as described herein, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.\nTechnical background: In the chemotherapeutic treatment of cancers, cisplatin (cis-diaminodichloroplatinum (II)) has been used successfully for many years in the treatment of various human solid malignant tumours for example testicular cancer, ovarian cancer and cancers of the head and neck, bladder, oesophagus and lung.\nMore recently, other diamino-platinum complexes, for example carboplatin (diamino(I,1-cyclobutane-dicarboxylato)platinum (II)), have also shown efficacy as chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of various human solid malignant tumours, carboplatin being approved for the treatment of ovarian and small cell lung cancer in particular in the treatment of ovarian cancer. A further antitumour platinum compound is oxaliplatin (L-OHP), a third generation diamino-cyclohexane platinum-based cytotoxic drug, which has the chemical name (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)oxalato-platinum (II). Oxaliplatin is used, for example, for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, based on its lack of renal toxicity and higher efficacy in preclinical models of cancer in comparison to cisplatin.\nOxaliplatin is used in combination with 5-FU, for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and is under investigation in the treatment of upper gastrointestinal cancer. An oral platinum derivative is under investigation for the treatment of prostate cancer.\nBiological activity: The platinum compounds of the combinations of the invention have activity against various cancers.\nProblems: Although cisplatin and other platinum compounds have been widely used as chemotherapeutic agents in humans, they are not therapeutically effective in all patients or against all types of tumours. Moreover, such compounds need to be administered at relatively high dosage levels which can lead to toxicity problems such as kidney damage, myelosuppression and neuropathy. Also, and especially with cisplatin, the compounds cause nausea and vomiting in patients to a varying extent, as well as leucopenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia. There is therefore a need to increase efficacy and also to provide a means for the use of lower dosages to reduce the potential of adverse toxic side effects to the patient.\nPreferences: Preferred platinum compounds for use in accordance with the invention include cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin. Other platinum compounds include chloro(diethylenediamino)-platinum (II) chloride; dichloro(ethylenediamino)-platinum (II); spiroplatin; iproplatin; diamino(2-ethylmalonato)platinum (II); (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)malonatoplatinum (II); (4-carboxyphthalo)-(1,2-diaminocyclohexane)platinum (II); (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)-(isocitrato)platinum (II); (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)-cis-(pyruvato)platinum (II); onnaplatin; and tetraplatin. Cisplatin is commercially available for example under the trade name Platinol from Bristol-Myers Squibb Corporation as a powder for constitution with water, sterile saline or other suitable vehicle. Cisplatin may also be prepared for example as described by G. B. Kauffman and D. O. Cowan, Inorg. Synth. 7, 239 (1963), or by processes analogous thereto. Carboplatin is commercially available for example from Bristol-Myers Squibb Corporation under the trade name Paraplatin, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. patent specification No. 4140707, or by processes analogous thereto. Oxaliplatin is commercially available for example from Sanofi-Synthelabo Inc under the trade name Eloxatin, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,169,846, or by processes analogous thereto. Other platinum compounds and their pharmaceutical compositions are commercially available and/or can be prepared by conventional techniques.\nSpecific embodiments: In one embodiment, the platinum compound is selected from chloro(diethylenediamino)-platinum (II) chloride; dichloro(ethylenediamino)-platinum (II); spiroplatin; iproplatin; diamino(2-ethylmalonato)platinum (II); (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)malonatoplatinum (II); (4-carboxyphthalo)-(1,2-diaminocyclohexane)platinum (II); (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)-(isocitrato)platinum (II); (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)-cis-(pyruvato)platinum (II); onnaplatin; tetraplatin, cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin. In another embodiment, the platinum compound is a platinum compound other than cisplatin, for example a platinum compound such as chloro(diethylenediamino)-platinum (II) chloride; dichloro(ethylenediamino)-platinum (II); spiroplatin; iproplatin; diamino(2-ethylmalonato)platinum (II); (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)malonatoplatinum (II); (4-carboxyphthalo)-(1,2-diaminocyclohexane)platinum (II); (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)-(isocitrato)platinum (II); (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)-cis-(pyruvato)platinum (II); onnaplatin; tetraplatin, carboplatin or oxaliplatin, preferably selected from carboplatin and oxaliplatin.\nPosology: The platinum coordination compound is advantageously administered in a dosage of 1 to 500 mg per square meter (mg/m2) of body surface area, for example 50 to 400 mg/m2 or 500 mg/m2 (e.g. 50 to 400 mg/m2) particularly for cisplatin in a dosage of about 75 mg/m2, for carboplatin in about 300-500 mg/m2 e.g. 300 mg/m2, and for oxaliplatin in about 50-100 mg/m2. These dosages may be administered for example once, twice or more per course of treatment, which may be repeated for example every 7, 14, 21 or 28 days.\n11. Topoisomerase 2 Inhibitors\nDefinition: The term \u201ctopoisomerase 2 inhibitor\u201d as used herein refers to topoisomerase 2 inhibitor or analogues of topoisomerase 2 inhibitor as described above, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.\nTechnical background: An important class of anticancer drugs are the inhibitors of the enzyme topoisomerase 2 which causes double-strand breaks to release stress build-up during DNA transcription and translation. Compounds that inhibit the function of this enzyme are therefore cytotoxic and useful as anti-cancer agents.\nAmong the topoisomerase 2 inhibitors which have been developed and used in cancer chemotherapy are the podophyllotoxins. These drugs act by a mechanism of action which involves the induction of DNA strand breaks by an interaction with DNA topoisomerase 2 or the formation of free radicals. Podophyllotoxin, which is extracted from the mandrake plant, is the parent compound from which two glycosides have been developed which show significant therapeutic activity in several human neoplasms, including pediatric leukemia, small cell carcinomas of the lung, testicular tumours, Hodgkin's disease, and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Podophyllotoxin has activity in pediatric leukemia, small cell carcinomas of the lung, testicular tumours, Hodgkin's disease, and large cell lymphomas. These derivatives are etoposide (VP-16), which has the chemical name 4\u2032-demethylepipodophyllotoxin 9-[4,6-O\u2014(R)-ethylidene-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside], and teniposide (VM-26), which has the chemical name 4\u2032-demethylepipodophyllotoxin 9-[4,6-0-(R)-2-thenylidene-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside].\nBoth etoposide and teniposide, however, suffer from certain toxic side-effects especially myelosuppression. Another important class of topoisomerase 2 inhibitors are the anthracycline derivatives which are important anti-tumour agents and comprise antibiotics obtained from the fungus Streptomyces peuticus var. caesius and their derivatives, characterized by having a tetracycline ring structure with an unusual sugar, daunosamine, attached by a glycosidic linkage. Among these compounds, the most widely used include daunorubicin, which has the chemical name 7-(3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxy-L-lyxohexosyloxy)-9-acetyl-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-6,9,11-trihydroxy-4-methoxy-5,12-naphthacenequinone, doxorubicin, which has the chemical name 10-[(3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxy-\u03b1-L-lyxohexopyranosyl)oxy]-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-6,8,11-trihydroxy-8-(hydroxylacetyl)-I-methoxy-5,12-naphthacenedione, and idarubicin (Zavedos\u2122), which has the chemical name 9-acetyl-[(3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxy-\u03b1-L-lyxohexopyranosyl)oxy]-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-6,9,11-trihydroxy-5,12-naphthacenedione.\nDaunorubicin and idarubicin have been used primarily for the treatment of acute leukaemias whereas doxorubicin has been more widely tested against solid tumours particularly breast cancer. Another anthracycline derivative which is useful in cancer chemotherapy is epirubicin. Epirubicin, which has the chemical name (8S-cis)-10-[(3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxy-\u03b1-L-arabino-hexopyranosyl)oxy]-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-6,8,11-trihydroxy-8-(hydroxyacetyl)-1-methoxy-5,12-naphthacenedione, is a doxorubicin analog having a catabolic pathway that involves glucuronidation, by uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyl transferase in the liver (unlike that for doxorubicin), which is believed to account for its shorter half-life and reduced cardiotoxicity. The compound has been used for the treatment of various cancers including cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, advanced breast cancer and carcinoma of the bladder but suffers from the side-effects of myelosuppression and cardiotoxicity. The latter side-effect is typical of anthracycline derivatives which generally display a serious cardiomyopathy at higher cumulative doses. A further type of topoisomerase 2 inhibitor is represented by mitoxantrone, which has the chemical name 1,4-dihydroxy-5,8-bis[[2-[(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethyl]amino]-9,10-anthracenedione, and is used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute myelogenous leukaemia, and breast, prostate and liver tumours. Others include losoxantrone and actinomycin D (the latter agent also known as Dactinomycin and Cosmegen Lyovac\u00ae).\nSide-Effects from Administration of Mitoxantrone Include Myelosuppression, Nausea, Vomiting, Stomatitis and Alopecia\nBiological activity: The topoisomerase 2 inhibitors of the combinations of the invention have activity against various cancers as described above.\nProblems: This class of cytotoxic compound is associated with side effects, as mentioned above. Thus, there is a need to provide a means for the use of lower dosages to reduce the potential of adverse toxic side effects to the patient.\nPreferences: Preferred topoisomerase 2 inhibitor compounds for use in accordance with the invention include anthracycline derivatives, mitoxantrone and podophyllotoxin derivatives as defined to herein.\nPreferred anti-tumour anthracycline derivatives for use in accordance with the invention include daunorubicin, doxorubicin, idarubicin and epirubicin referred to above. Daunorubicin is commercially available for example as the hydrochloride salt from Bedford Laboratories under the trade name Cerubidine, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. patent specification No. 4020270, or by processes analogous thereto. The therapeutic index of daunorubicin in acute myeloid leukemia may be improved by encapsulating the molecule in a liposome (Daunoxome; Gilead/Diatos). Doxorubicin is commercially available for example from Pharmacia and Upjohn Co under the trade name Adriamycin, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,803,124, or by processes analogous thereto. Doxorubicin derivatives include pegylated doxorubicin hydrochloride and liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin citrate. Pegylated doxorubicin hydrochloride is commercially available from Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals under the trade name Caeylx; non-pegylated liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin citrate is commercially available for example from Cephalon Europe under the trade name Myocet. Idarubicin is commercially available for example as the hydrochloride salt from Pharmacia & Upjohn under the trade name Idamycin, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,046,878, or by processes analogous thereto. Epirubicin is commercially available for example from Pharmacia and Upjohn Co under the trade name Pharmorubicin, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,058,519, or by processes analogous thereto. Mitoxantrone is commercially available for example from OSI Pharmaceuticals, under the trade name Novantrone, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,197,249, or by processes analogous thereto.\nOther anti-tumour anthracycline derivatives may be prepared in conventional manner for example by processes analogous to those described above for the specific anthracycline derivatives.\nPreferred anti-tumour podophyllotoxin derivatives for use in accordance with the invention include etoposide and teniposide referred to above. Etoposide is commercially available for example from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co under the trade name VePesid, or may be prepared for example as described in European patent specification No 111058, or by processes analogous thereto. Teniposide is commercially available for example from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co under the trade name Vumon, or may be prepared for example as described in PCT patent specification No. WO 93/02094, or by processes analogous thereto. Other anti-tumour podophyllotoxin derivatives may be prepared in conventional manner for example by processes analogous to those described above for etoposide and teniposide.\nSpecific embodiments: In one embodiment, the topoisomerase 2 inhibitor is an anthracycline derivative, mitoxantrone or a podophyllotoxin derivative. In another embodiment, the topoisomerase 2 inhibitor is selected from daunorubicin, doxorubicin, idarubicin and epirubicin. In a further embodiment, the topoisomerase 2 inhibitor is selected from etoposide and teniposide. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, the topoisomerase 2 inhibitor is etoposide. In another embodiment, the topoisomerase 2 inhibitor is an anthracycline derivative other than doxorubicin, for example a topoisomerase 2 inhibitor such as daunorubicin, idarubicin and epirubicin.\nPosology: The anti-tumour anthracycline derivative is advantageously administered in a dosage of 10 to 150 mg per square meter (mg/m2) of body surface area, for example 15 to 60 mg/m2, particularly for doxorubicin in a dosage of about 40 to 75 mg/m2, for daunorubicin in a dosage of about 25 to 45 mg/m2, for idarubicin in a dosage of about 10 to 15 mg/m2 and for epirubicin in a dosage of about 100-120 mg/m2.\nMitoxantrone is advantageously administered in a dosage of about 12 to 14 mg/m2 as a short intravenous infusion about every 21 days.\nThe anti-tumour podophyllotoxin derivative is advantageously administered in a dosage of 30 to 300 mg/m2 of body surface area, for example 50 to 250 mg/m particularly for etoposide in a dosage of about 35 to 100 mg/m, and for teniposide in about 50 to 250 mg/m2.\nThe dosages noted above may generally be administered for example once, twice or more per course of treatment, which may be repeated for example every 7, 14, 21 or 28 days.\n12. Alkylating Agents\nDefinition: The term \u201calkylating agent\u201d or \u201calkylating agents\u201d as used herein refers to alkylating agents or analogues of alkylating agents as described herein, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.\nTechnical background: Alkylating agents used in cancer chemotherapy encompass a diverse group of chemicals that have the common feature that they have the capacity to contribute, under physiological conditions, alkyl groups to biologically vital macromolecules such as DNA. With most of the more important agents such as the nitrogen mustards and the nitrosoureas, the active alkylating moieties are generated in vivo after complex degradative reactions, some of which are enzymatic. The most important pharmacological actions of the alkylating agents are those that disturb the fundamental mechanisms concerned with cell proliferation, in particular DNA synthesis and cell division. The capacity of alkylating agents to interfere with DNA function and integrity in rapidly proliferating tissues provides the basis for their therapeutic applications and for many of their toxic properties. Alkylating agents as a class have therefore been investigated for their anti-tumour activity and certain of these compounds have been widely used in anti-cancer therapy although they tend to have in common a propensity to cause dose-limiting toxicity to bone marrow elements and to a lesser extent the intestinal mucosa.\nAmong the alkylating agents, the nitrogen mustards represent an important group of anti-tumour compounds which are characterised by the presence of a bis-(2-chloroethyl) grouping and include cyclophosphamide, which has the chemical name 2-[bis(2-chloroethyl)amino]tetrahydro-2H-1,3,2-oxazaphospholine oxide, and chlorambucil, which has the chemical name 4-[bis(2-chloroethyl)amino]-benzenebutoic acid. Cyclophosphamide has a broad spectrum of clinical activity and is used as a component of many effective drug combinations for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, Burkitt's lymphoma and breast cancer. Cyclophosphamide has also been used as a component of combinations for malignant lymphomas.\nIfosfamide (a.k.a. ifosphamide) is a structural analogue of cyclophosphamide and its mechanism of action is presumed to be identical. It has the chemical name 3-(2-chloroethyl)-2-[(2-chloroethyl)amino]tetrahydro-2H-1,3,2-oxazaphosphorin-2-oxide, and is used for the treatment of cervical cancer, sarcoma, and testicular cancer but may have severe urotoxic effects. Chlorambucil has been used for treating chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Chlorambucil has also been used for treating CLL and malignant lymphomas including lymphosarcoma.\nAnother important class of alkylating agents are the nitrosoureas which are characterised by the capacity to undergo spontaneous non-enzymatic degradation with the formation of the 2-chloroethyl carbonium ion. Examples of such nitrosourea compounds include carmustine (BiCNU\u00ae or BCNU) which has the chemical name 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-I-nitrosourea, and lomustine (CCNU) which has the chemical name 1-(2-chloroethyl)cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea. Carmustine and lomustine each have an important therapeutic role in the treatment of brain tumours and gastrointestinal neoplasms although these compounds cause profound, cumulative myelosuppression that restricts their therapeutic value.\nAnother class of alkylating agent is represented by the bifunctional alkylating agents having a bis-alkanesulfonate group and represented by the compound busulfan which has the chemical name 1,4-butanediol dimethanesulfonate, and is used for the treatment of chronic myelogenous (myeloid, myelocytic or granulocytic) leukaemia. However, it can induce severe bone marrow failure resulting in severe pancytopenia. This property has led to its widespread usage as a conditioning agent prior to hematological stem cell transplantation.\nAnother class of alkylating agent are the aziridine compounds containing a three-membered nitrogen-containing ring which act as anti-tumour agents by binding to DNA, leading to cross-linking and inhibition of DNA synthesis and function. An example of such an agent is mitomycin, an antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces caespitosus, and having the chemical name 7-amino-9\u03b1-methoxymitosane.\nMitomycin is used to treat adenocarcinoma of stomach, pancreas, colon and breast, small cell and non-small cell lung cancer, and, in combination with radiation, head and neck cancer, side-effects including myelosuppression, nephrotoxicity, interstitial pneumonitis, nausea and vomiting.\nBiological activity: One of the most important pharmacological actions of the alkylating agent in combination with the invention is its ability to disturb the fundamental mechanisms concerned with cell proliferation as herein before defined.

COX-2 Inhibitors\nDefinition: The term \u201cCOX-2 inhibitor\u201d is used herein to define compounds which inhibit or modulate the activity of the cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.\nBiological activity: The COX-2 inhibitors working via one or more pharmacological actions as described herein have been identified as suitable anti-cancer agents.\nTechnical background: Recently, research in cancer chemotherapy has focused on the role of the cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme in the aetiology of cancer. Epidemiological studies have shown that people who regularly take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), for example aspirin and ibuprofen to treat conditions such as arthritis, have lower rates of colorectal polyps, colorectal cancer, and death due to colorectal cancer. NSAIDs block cyclooxygenase enzymes, which are produced by the body in inflammatory processes, and which are also produced by pre-cancerous tissues. For example in colon cancers, a dramatic increase of COX-2 levels is observed. One of the key factors for tumour growth is the supply of blood to support its increased size. Many tumours can harness chemical pathways that prompt the body to create a web of new blood vessels around the cancer, a process called angiogenesis. COX-2 is believed to have a role in this process. It has therefore been concluded that inhibition of COX-2 may be effective for treating cancer, and COX-2 inhibitors have been developed for this purpose. For example celecoxib, which has the chemical name 4-[5-(4-methylphenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]benzenesulfonamide, is a selective COX-2 inhibitor that is being investigated for the treatment of various cancers including bladder and esophageal cancer, renal cell carcinoma, cervical cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-small cell lung cancer.\nPosology: The COX-2 inhibitor (for example celecoxib) can be administered in a dosage such as 100 to 200 mg e.g. daily.\nThese dosages may also be administered for example once, twice or more per course of treatment, which may be repeated for example every 7, 14, 21 or 28 days.\nProblems: The most common adverse effects are headache, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, diarrhea, nausea, flatulence and insomnia. There is a need to provide a means for the use of lower dosages of COX-2 inhibitors to reduce the potential for adverse toxic side effects to the patient.\nPreferences and specific embodiments: In one embodiment the COX-2 inhibitor is celecoxib. Celecoxib is commercially available for example from Pfizer Inc under the trade name Celebrex, or may be prepared for example as described in PCT patent specification No. WO 95/15316, or by processes analogous thereto.\nTwo other commercially available COX-2 inhibitors are Arcoxia (etoricoxib from Merck) and Novartis Cox-2 inhibitor lumiracoxib (Prexige).\n15. HDAC Inhibitors\nDefinition: The term \u201cHDAC inhibitor\u201d is used herein to define compounds which inhibit or modulate the activity of histone deacetylases (HDAC), including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.\nBiological activity: The HDAC inhibitors working via one or more pharmacological actions as described herein have been identified as suitable anti-cancer agents.\nTechnical background: Reversible acetylation of histones is a major regulator of gene expression that acts by altering accessibility of transcription factors to DNA. In normal cells, histone deacetylase (HDAC) and histone acetyltrasferase (HDA) together control the level of acetylation of histones to maintain a balance. Inhibition of HDA results in the accumulation of hyperacetylated histones, which results in a variety of cellular responses. Inhibitors of HDA (HDAI) have been studied for their therapeutic effects on cancer cells. Recent developments in the field of HDAI research have provided active compounds, that are suitable for treating tumours.\nAccruing evidence suggests that HDAI are more efficacious when used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. There are both synergistic and additive advantages, both for efficacy and safety. Therapeutic effects of combinations of chemotherapeutic agents with HDAI can result in lower safe dosage ranges of each component in the combination.\nThe study of inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDAC) indicate that these enzymes play an important role in cell proliferation and differentiation. The inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) causes cell cycle arrest at both G1 and G2 phases, reverts the transformed phenotype of different cell lines, and induces differentiation of Friend leukaemia cells and others. TSA (and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid SAHA) have been reported to inhibit cell growth, induce terminal differentiation, and prevent the formation of tumours in mice (Finnin et al., Nature, 401:188-193, 1999).\nTrichostatin A has also been reported to be useful in the treatment of fibrosis, e.g. liver fibrosis and liver chirrhosis. (Geerts et al., European Patent Application EPO 827 742, published 11 Mar. 1998).\nPreferences and specific embodiments: Preferred HDAC inhibitors for use in accordance with the invention are selected from TSA, SAHA, JNJ-16241199, LAQ-824, MGCD-0103 and PXD-101 (referred to above).\nThus, synthetic inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDAC) which are suitable for use in the present invention include JNJ-16241199 from Johnson and Johnson Inc, LAQ-824 from Novartis, MGCD-0103 from MethylGene, and PXD-101 from Prolifix.\nJNJ-16241199 has the following structure:\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nMGCD-0103 has the structure:\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nLAQ-824 has the structure:\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nOther inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDAC) which are suitable for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, the peptide chlamydocin, and A-173, also from Abbott Laboratories.\nA-173 is a succinimide macrocyclic compound with the following structure:\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nPosology: In general, for HDAC inhibitors it is contemplated that a therapeutically effective amount would be from 0.005 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg body weight, and in particular from 0.005 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg body weight. It may be appropriate to administer the required dose as two, three, four or more sub-doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day. Said sub-doses may be formulated as unit dosage forms, for example, containing 0.5 to 500 mg, and in particular 10 mg to 500 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form.\n16. Selective Immunoresponse Modulators\nSelective immunoresponse modulators include Lenalidomide and Thalidomide.\nLenalidomide (Revlimid) is an oral thalidomide derivative developed by Celgene which is a potent inhibitor of TNF-alpha and interleukin-1 beta which is being developed for the treatment of 5q-myelodysplastic syndrome multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia gliomas, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and epithelial ovarian cancer.\nLenalidomide (3-(4-amino-1-oxoisoindolin-2-yl)piperidine-2,6-dione) has the following structure:\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nThalidomide is a sedative and anti-emetic that became widely recognized as a result of reports of its teratogenic effects, most notably limb deformities in up to 12,000 children born to women who had received thalidomide in Europe and Canada during the 1960s. Celgene has developed and launched thalidomide as an oral TNF-alpha inhibitor (Sold to Pharmion). Extensive clinical evidence has accumulated with regard to the potential antitumor activity of thalidomide in several types of neoplasias, with notable activity in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). There is also evidence of biological activity in acute myeloid leukemia, myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia, renal cell carcinoma, malignant gliomas, prostate cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma and colorectal carcinoma.\nThalidomide (1,3-dioxo-2-(2,6-dioxopiperidin-3-yl)isoindoline) has the following structure:\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nPosology. Thalidomide may be advantageously administered in dosages of 100 to 800 mg/day continuously as tolerated. Lenalidomide may be advantageously administered in 5- to 40-mg doses continuously as tolerated.\n17. DNA Methylase Inhibitors\nDefinition: The term \u201cDNA methylase inhibitor\u201d or \u201cDNA methyltransferase inhibitor\u201d as used herein refers to a compound which directly or indirectly perturbs, disrupts, blocks, modulates or inhibits the methylation of DNA, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above. They are also referred to as \u201chypomethylating agents\u201d.\nBiological activity: The DNA methylase inhibitors working via one or more pharmacological actions as described herein have been identified as suitable anti-cancer agents.\nTechnical background: One target for cancer chemotherapy is DNA synthesis, which may depend on appropriate methylation of tumour DNA. Compounds which directly or indirectly perturb, disrupt, block, modulate or inhibit the methylation of DNA may therefore be useful anticancer drugs.\nThe DNA methylase inhibitor temozolomide is used for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme, and first-line treatment of patients with advanced metastatic malignant melanoma (such as first-line treatment of patients with advanced metastatic malignant melanoma) and has also being investigated and used for the treatment of malignant glioma at first relapse. This compound undergoes rapid chemical conversion at physiological pH to the active compound, monomethyl triazeno imidazole carboxamide (MTIC) which is responsible for the methylation of DNA at the O6 position of guanine residues (which appears to lead to a suppression in expression of DNA methyltransferase and so produce hypomethylation).\nProblems: The most common side effects associated with temozolomide therapy are nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue, thrombocytopenia and constipation. There is a need to increase the inhibitory efficacy of DNA\\methylase inhibitors and to provide a means for the use of lower dosages of signaling inhibitors to reduce the potential for adverse toxic side effects to the patient.\nPreferences and specific embodiments: In one embodiment, the DNA methylase inhibitor is temozolomide (3,4-dihydro-3-methyl-4-oxoimidazo[5,1-d]-as-tetrazine-8-carboxamide). Temozolomide is commercially available for example from Schering Corporation under the trade name Temodar, or may be prepared for example as described in German patent specification No. 3231255, or by processes analogous thereto.\nA further DNA methyltransferase inhibitor for use in the combinations of the invention is Decitabine (a.k.a. Dacogen) having the structure shown below:\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nSuperGen Inc and MGI Pharma Inc have developed decitabine (Dacogen), an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, preventing methylation of cytosine residues on DNA and leading to hypomethylation of gene promoters, thereby reactivating silenced genes. Decitabine/Dacogen is cytotoxic to a broad range of malignant cells in vitro. It shows significant activity against acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Decitabine/Dacogen is indicated for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and secondary MDS (including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, refractory anemia, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, refractory anemia with excess blasts and refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation).\nDecitabine/Dacogen is an analog of deoxycytidine (beta-D-anomer of 2\u2032-deoxy-5-azacytidine). It differs from deoxycytidine by substitution at position 5 of the pyrimidine ring with nitrogen. Decitabine contains deoxyribose, in contrast to the related analog, Pharmion Corp's 5-azacytidine (Vidaza), which contains a ribose sugar. Decitabine is, therefore, a deoxynucleoside and is incorporated into DNA, but not RNA, in contrast to 5-azacytidine which is incorporated into RNA. Decitabine and 5-azacytidine differ from other pyrimidine analogs, such as cytosine arabinoside and gemcitabine, by modification at position 5 of the pyrimidine ring. This distinctive feature, which is not present in these latter drugs, is responsible for inhibition of DNA methyltransferase. Pseudoisocytidine and 5-fluoro-2\u2032-deoxycytidine, further analogs with modifications of the 5 position of the pyrimidine ring, also inhibit demethylation.\nDecitabine/Dacogen is dosed at 15 mg/m2 over a three hour period every 8 hours for 3 days every 6 weeks as a cycle of therapy or on a daily dosing schedule with a one hour infusion usually delivered at 20 mg/m2 per day either for one week or two weeks every 6 weeks as a cycle\nAt toxic doses decitabine/Dacogen produces leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and weight loss. The major toxicity of decitabine is myelosuppression, which is proportional to dose and duration of therapy. The effects are pronounced at high doses (>200 mg/m2/day), and myelosuppression is enhanced by concomitant administration of other cytotoxic drugs. Neutropenic infection and other complications of myelosuppression have proved fatal. Non-hematological side effects include nausea, vomiting, mucositis and alopecia.\nDecitabine/Dacogen and other analogues thereof can be made as outlined in U.S. Pat. No. 3,432,549 and further discussed on WO 006/017278 and WO 2006/037024 to SuperGen Inc.\nA further DNA methyltransferase inhibitor for use in the combinations of the invention is azacytidine (a.k.a. 5-azacitidine, 5-azacytidine or Vidaza) a sc administered hypomethylating agent and DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It is indicated for the treatment of all myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) subtypes, including refractory anemia (RA) or RA with ringed sideroblasts, RA with excess blasts, RA with excess blasts in transformation and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.\n5-azacitidine (Vidaza) can be administered twice-daily subcutaneously or via the iv route administration for MDS treatment.\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nIt can be prepared as described in DE 1922702, GB 1227691 and FR 2008048 from Ceskoslovenska Akademie Ved and WO 2004082618, WO 2004082619 and WO 2004082822 from Pharmion and process analogous thereto.\nPosology: The DNA methylating agent (for example temozolomide) can be administered in a dosage such as 0.5 to 2.5 mg per square meter (mg/m2) of body surface area, particularly about 1.3 mg/m2. These dosages may be administered for example once, twice or more per course of treatment, which may be repeated for example every 7, 14, 21 or 28 days.\n18. Proteasome Inhibitors\nDefinition: The term \u201cproteasome inhibitor\u201d as used herein refers to compounds which directly or indirectly perturb, disrupt, block, modulate or inhibit the half-life of many short-lived biological processes, such as those involved in the cell cycle. The term therefore embraces compounds which block the action of proteasomes (large protein complexes that are involved in the turnover of other cellular proteins). The term also embraces the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.\nBiological activity: The proteasome inhibitors working via one or more pharmacological actions as described herein have been identified as suitable anti-cancer agents.\nTechnical background: Another class of anticancer agents are the proteasome inhibitors. Proteasomes control the half-life of many short-lived biological processes, such as those involved in the cell cycle. Therefore, proteasome malfunction can lead to abnormal regulation of the cell cycle and uncontrolled cell growth.\nThe cell cycle is controlled by both positive and negative signals. In a normal cell, proteasomes break down proteins that inhibit the cell cycle, such as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. Inhibition of proteasome function causes cell cycle arrest and cell death. Tumour cells are more susceptible to these effects than normal cells, in part because they divide more rapidly and in part because many of their normal regulatory pathways are disrupted. The mechanism for the differential response of normal and cancer cells to proteasome inhibition is not fully understood. Overall, cancer cells are more susceptible to proteasome inhibitors and, as a result, these inhibitors may be an effective treatment for certain cancers.\nOne such proteasome inhibitor is bortezimib, which has the chemical name [(1R)-3-methyl-1-[[(2S)-1-oxo-3-phenyl-2-[(pyrazinylcarbonyl)amino]propyl]amino]butyl]-boronic acid. Bortezimib specifically interacts with a key amino acid, namely threonine, within the catalytic site of the proteasome. Bortezimib is being used for the treatment of multiple myeloma and also for a number of other cancers, including leukemia and lymphoma, and prostate, pancreatic and colorectal carcinoma. In addition Velcade is useful for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\nProblems: The most common side effects with bortezimib are nausea, tiredness, diarrhea, constipation, decreased platelet blood count, fever, vomiting, and decreased appetite. Bortezimib can also cause peripheral neuropathy.\nThus, there is a need to provide a means for the use of lower dosages to reduce the potential of adverse toxic side effects to the patient.\nPreferences and specific embodiments: Preferred proteasome inhibitors for use in accordance with the invention include bortezimib. Bortezimib is commercially available for example from Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc under the trade name Velcade, or may be prepared for example as described in PCT patent specification No. WO 96/13266, or by processes analogous thereto.\nPosology: The proteasome inhibitor (such as bortezimib) can be administered in a dosage such as 100 to 200 mg/m2. These dosages may be administered for example once, twice or more per course of treatment, which may be repeated for example every 7, 14, 21 or 28 days.\nThe antibiotic bleomycin may also be used as a cytotoxic agent as an anti-cancer agent according to the invention.\n19. Aurora Inhibitors\nIn one embodiment of the invention, the ancillary compound is an Aurora kinase inhibitor or modulator. Such Aurora inhibitors or modulators may be selected from the various Aurora inhibitors described herein and preferred ancillary Aurora inhibitors are discussed in more detail below.\nDefinition: The term \u201cAurora kinase inhibitor\u201d (or simply \u201cAurora inhibitor\u201d) as used herein refers to compounds that inhibit or modulate the activity of any of the Aurora kinase isoforms A, B and/or C as described herein, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.\nTechnical Background: Aurora kinases play a role in regulating the cell cycle and in particular in the process of cellular mitosis (they have an important role in the mitotic phase of the cell cycle). Therefore, Aurora kinase inhibitors may find application in the treatment of diseases in which there is a disorder of proliferation, cell division, differentiation such as cancer. In particular tumours with mitotic and or spindle defects may be particularly sensitive to CDK inhibitors.\nInhibition of the Aurora kinases has been shown to substantially disrupt the mitotic process leading to early mitotic effects from inhibition of Aurora A and late abnormalities of cytokinesis by inhibition of Aurora B. Combining Aurora kinase inhibitors with agents that activate, interfere with or modulate the mitotic or cell cycle checkpoint sensitises cells to the cytotoxic effects and a beneficial combination effect is observed (Anand S, Penrhyn-Lowe S, Venkitaraman A R. Cancer Cell. 2003 January; 3(1):51-62). In this context a combination of Aurora kinase inhibitors with the taxanes, epothilones or vinca alkaloids are beneficial. Particular taxanes, epothilones and vinca alkaloids are described herein.\nExamples of auxiliary Aurora kinase inhibitors include AZD1152, MK0457 (VX680), PHA-739358, MLN-8054, MP-235 in particular MK0457 (VX680), PHA-739358, MLN-8054, MP-235. AZD1152 is undergoing clinical evaluation. AZD1152 is a pro-drug which is converted rapidly to the active moiety AZD1152-HQPA in the plasma (AZD-1152 hydroxy-QPA, structure shown below). In early studies in patients with advanced solid malignancies, AZD1152 given in a 2 hr infusion weekly, induces p53 independent cellular multinucleation and polyploidy, resulting in apoptosis. These early studies indicate neutropenia is the dose-limiting toxicology (ASCO 2006).\nAZD1152 is undergoing clinical evaluation.

WO 2005/002552 is incorporated herein by reference and relates to compounds of Formula (I) as laid out therein.\n20. Hsp90 Inhibitors\nIn one embodiment of the invention, the ancillary agent is an inhibitor of Hsp90.\nPreferred Hsp90 inhibitors for use as ancillary agents in the combinations of the invention are compounds of formula (I) as defined herein. However, Hsp90 inhibitors for use in the combinations of the invention also include the ancillary Hsp90 inhibitors described in more detail below that have Hsp90 inhibiting or modulating activity. Thus, the combinations of the present invention may comprise (or consist essentially of) two or more compounds of formula (I) as defined herein.\nIn addition to the Hsp90 inhibitors of formula I herein, the combinations of the present invention may include one or more ancillary Hsp90 inhibitors or modulators. Such ancillary Hsp90 inhibitors or modulators may be selected from the various Hsp90 inhibitors described herein and preferred ancillary Hsp90 inhibitors are discussed in more detail below.\nDefinition: The term Hsp90 inhibitor as used herein refers to compounds that inhibit or modulate the activity of Heat Shock Protein 90 as described herein.\nThe term \u201cancillary Hsp90 inhibitor\u201d as used herein refers to compounds that inhibit or modulate the activity of Heat Shock Protein 90 and which does not conform to the structure of formula (I) as defined herein, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.\nTechnical Background: In response to cellular stresses including heat, toxins, radiation, infection, inflammation, and oxidants, all cells produce a common set of heat shock proteins (Hsps) (Macario & de Macario 2000). Most heat shock proteins act as molecular chaperones. Chaperones bind and stabilize proteins at intermediate stages of folding and allow proteins to fold to their functional states. Hsp90 is the most abundant cytosolic Hsp under normal conditions. There are two human isoforms of Hsp90, a major form Hsp90a and minor form Hsp906. Hsp90 binds proteins at a late stage of folding and is distinguished from other Hsps in that most of its protein substrates are involved in signal transduction. It has been shown that ATP bound at the N-terminal pocket of Hsp90 is hydrolysed. This ATPase activity results in a conformational change in Hsp90 that is required to enable conformational changes in the client protein.\nActivation of Hsp90 is further regulated through interactions with a variety of other chaperone proteins and can be isolated in complex with other chaperones including Hsp70, Hip, Hop, p23, and p50cdc37. Many other co-chaperone proteins have also been demonstrated to bind Hsp90. There is some evidence that Hsp90 is found primarily within \u201cactivated\u201d multichaperone complexes in the tumour cells as opposed to \u201clatent\u201d complexes in normal cells.\nIncreased genetic instability associated with the cancer phenotype leads to an increase in the production of non-native or mutant proteins. The ubiquitin pathway also serves to protect the cell from non-native or misfolded proteins, by targeting these proteins for proteasomal degradation. Mutant proteins are by their nature not native and therefore have the potential to show structural instability and an increased requirement for the chaperone system. (Giannini et al., Mol Cell Biol. 2004; 24(13):5667-76).\nThe number of reported Hsp90 client proteins now exceeds 100. Since many of its client proteins are involved in cell signalling proliferation and survival, Hsp90 has received major interest as an oncology target. Hsp90 protein kinase client proteins implicated in cell proliferation and survival include the following; Cellular Src (c-Src), ErbB2 (Her2/neu), Polo-like kinases (Plks), Akt (PKB), c-Raf, B-RAF, Mek, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), c-met, Cdk1, Cdk2, Cdk4, and Cdk6, Wee-1, Mutant p53, Hypoxia inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a)\nExamples of Hsp90 inhibitors include herbimycin, geldanamycin (GA), 17-AAG e.g. Kos-953 and CNF-1010, 17-DMAG (Kos-1022), CNF-2024 (an oral purine), and IPI-504, in particular 17-AAG e.g. Kos-953 and CNF-1010, 17-DMAG (Kos-1022), CNF-2024, and IPI-504. Preferred compounds are geldanamycin analogs such as 17-AAG e.g. Kos-953 and CNF-1010, 17-DMAG (Kos-1022), and IPI-504.\nAnsamycin antibiotics herbimycin, geldanamycin (GA) and 17-allylamino-17-desmethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) are ATP binding site inhibitors that block the binding of ATP and prevent conversion to the mature complex (Grenert et, al., 1997. J Biol Chem., 272:23834-23850). Despite Hsp90 being ubiquitously expressed, GA and its analogues have a higher binding affinity for Hsp90 derived from tumour vs. normal cell lines (Kamal et. al., Nature 2003; 425: 407-410). GA also shows more potent cytotoxic activity in tumour cells and is sequestered at higher concentrations within tumours in xenograft mouse models (Brazidec J. Med. Chem. 2004, 47, 3865-3873). Furthermore the ATP-ase activity of Hsp90 is elevated in cancer cells and is an indication of the increased level of stress in these cells. Hsp90 gene amplification has also been reported to occur in the later stages of cancer (Jolly and Morimoto JNCI Vol. 92, No. 19, 1564-1572, 2000).\n17-MG (NSC-330507, 17-allylaminogeldanamycin) is an injectable semisynthetic derivative of geldanamycin and a polyketide inhibitor of Hsp90 identified at the University of Maryland under development by Kosan Biosciences, in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the UK Institute of Cancer Research, for the potential treatment of cancer. Studies of 17-AAG have been initiated in melanoma, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) and as a combination therapy with imatinib (qv) for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).\nThe structure of 17-MG is outlined below. It can be prepared as described in WO 02/36574 and processes analogous those described therein.\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nKOS-953 is a 17-AAG formulation developed by Kosan that replaces the DMSO-egg lecithin vehicle used in the original formulation, with the aim of improving patient tolerability and providing greater stability. This can be prepared as described in WO 2005/110398 and processes analogous those described therein.\nis developing CNF-1010, an organic solvent-free lipid-based formulation of 17-AAG (qv) for the potential iv treatment of cancer. This can be prepared as described in WO 03/026571, WO 02/069900 and WO 2006/050333 and processes analogous those described therein. An oral formulation of 17-AAG is described by Conforma in US 2006/0067953.\n17-DMAG (17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin hydrochloride, NSC-707545; structure shown) is an analog of 17-AAG (qv). It is a water-soluble geldanamycin derivative and it is being investigated for advanced solid tumors. Kosan, under license from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), is developing an iv formulation of KOS-1022 (17-DMAG), for the potential treatment of solid tumors. Kosan is also developing an oral formulation of KOS-1022 (qv) for the same indication.\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nIt can be prepared as described in WO 03/013430 and processes analogous to those described therein.\nInfinity is developing the Hsp90 inhibitor IPI-504, a further analog of 17-AAG (qv) that is soluble in aqueous formulations for iv administration, for the potential treatment of cancer. Infinity started studies of IPI-504 in multiple myeloma (MM), and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), and the compound has potential for other haematological cancers and solid tumors.\nThe structure of IPI-504, a reduced form of 17-AAG called 18,21-didehydro-17-demethoxy-18,21-dideoxo-18,21-dihydroxy-17-(2-propenylamino)-geldanamycin monohydrochloride, is shown below. It can be prepared as described in WO 2005/063714 and processes analogous those described therein.\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nConforma Therapeutics is developing CNF-2024, a synthetic oral Hsp 90 inhibitor, for the potential treatment of cancer. CNF-2024 is an oral purine analogue.\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nIt can be prepared as described in J Med Chem (2006) 49: 817-828.\n21. Checkpoint Targeting Agents\nThe cell proliferation cycle is a complex process during which the cell first replicates its chromosomes and then undergoes cell division or cytokinesis. At various stages of the cycle, mechanisms exist to prevent further progression through the cycle until all appropriate events have occurred. This ensures the integrity of the DNA of the cell as it progresses through the cycle in the required sequential manner. One such checkpoint is known to occur in mitosis. This is variously referred to as the mitotic or spindle checkpoint. Cells are held at this checkpoint until all chromosomes are appropriately attached to the mitotic spindle via their centrosomes. Defects in this checkpoint lead to either aneuploid phenotypes, typical of cancer cells or an imbalance of chromosomes in daughter cells. Some cancer therapies are known to act by disruption of this checkpoint causing chromosome mis-alignment or premature cytokinesis leading to activation of a checkpoint that results in preferential death of the tumour cell. For example the taxanes and epothilones are classes of agents which cause stabilisation of spindle microtubules preventing the normal spindle contraction process. The vinca alkaloids are another class of agents which act to prevent spindle formation via an action on tubulin the principal protein in the microtubules. Agents which cause DNA damage or disrupt DNA replication including platinum compounds and nucleoside analogues such as 5-FU lead to cell arrest at checkpoints and subsequent cell death. They thus require a functional checkpoint for their therapeutic action.\nThe Aurora kinases have an important role in the mitotic phase of the cell cycle. Inhibition of the Aurora kinases has been shown to substantially disrupt the mitotic process leading to early mitotic effects from inhibition of Aurora A and late abnormalities of cytokinesis by inhibition of Aurora B. It is believed that combining Aurora kinase inhibitors with agents that activate, interfere with or modulate the mitotic or cell cycle checkpoint could sensitise cells to the cytotoxic effects and a beneficial combination effect could be observed (Anand S, Penrhyn-Lowe S, Venkitaraman A R. Cancer Cell. 2003 January; 3(1):51-62). In this context a combination of Aurora kinase inhibitors with the taxanes, epothilones or vinca alkaloids would be beneficial. Particular taxanes, epothilones and vinca alkaloids are described herein.\nFurther checkpoint targeting agents are those that cause DNA damage or disrupt DNA replication including platinum compounds such as cisplatin and nucleoside analogues such as 5-FU leading to cell arrest at checkpoints and subsequent cell death. In this context a combination of Aurora kinase inhibitors with the platinum compounds and nucleoside analogues would be beneficial as they could sensitise cells to the cytotoxic effects. Particular platinum compounds and nucleoside analogues are described herein.\nFurther checkpoint targeting agents that activate, interfere with or modulate the cell cycle checkpoints which would also be particularly beneficial for use in combination with Aurora inhibitors include polo-like kinase inhibitors (Plks), CHK kinase inhibitors, inhibitors of the BUB kinase family and kinesin inhibitors. Polo-like kinases are important regulators of cell cycle progression during M-phase. Plks are involved in the assembly of the mitotic spindle apparatus and in the activation of CDK/cyclin complexes. Plk1 regulates tyrosine dephosphorylation of CDKs through phosphorylation and activation of Cdc25C. CDK1 activation in turn leads to spindle formation and entry into M phase. The importance of Checkpoint kinases such as Chk1 and Chk2 is described herein.\nThus other agents in development which act to disrupt the mitotic checkpoint and therefore could be combined beneficially with Aurora inhibitors include polo-like kinase inhibitors (e.g. BI-2536), CHK kinase inhibitors (e.g. Irofulven (a CHK2 inhibitor), 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01, an inhibitor of both CHK1 and PKC) and PD-321852), inhibitors of the BUB kinase family, and kinesin inhibitors (also known as mitotic kinesin spindle protein (KSP) inhibitors) such as CK0106023, CK-0060339 and SB-743921 (structures shown below).\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nCK0106023, CK-0060339 and SB-743921 can be prepared and used as described in WO 01/30768 and WO 01/98278 and processes analogous thereto.\nCHK kinase inhibitors include irofulven, UCN-01 and PD-321852. Irofulven (structure shown) is a semisynthetic compound derived from illudin S, a toxin from the Omphalotus illudens mushroom, for the potential treatment of refractory and relapsed tumors, including ovarian, prostate, hepatocellular, breast, lung and colon cancers, and gliomas. This can be synthesised as described in WO 98/05669 or processes analogous thereto.\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nPD-321852, a checkpoint kinase Chk I inhibitor, (structure shown), is being investigated by Pfizer for the potential treatment of cancer.\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nIt can be prepared and used as described in WO 01/53274, WO 01/53268 and in particular WO 03/091255 or processes analogous thereto.\nBI-2536 (structure shown below) an inhibitor of the serine-threonine kinase polo-like kinase-1 (PLK-1), for the potential treatment of solid tumors. It can be prepared and used as described in WO2004/076454, WO 2006/018220, WO 2006/018221 and WO 2006/018222 or processes analogous thereto.\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nIn addition, checkpoint targeting agents that arrest cells in G2/M phase could also be combined with the Aurora kinase inhibitors of the invention to have a similar beneficial effect. Therefore Platinum compounds and CDK inhibitors would be therefore be beneficial in combination with the combinations of the invention and are thus further Checkpoint Targeting Agents. Particular Platinum compounds and CDK inhibitors are described herein.\nThus, examples of Checkpoint Targeting Agents for use according to the invention include Platinum compounds, nucleoside analogues, CDK inhibitors, Taxanes, Vinca alkaloids, polo-like kinase inhibitors, CHK kinase inhibitors, inhibitors of the BUB kinase family and kinesin inhibitors, in particular Platinum compounds, nucleoside analogues, Taxanes and Vinca alkaloids more particularly checkpoint targeting agents which target the mititoic checkpoint such as Taxanes and Vinca alkaloids. Particular combinations of the invention include cisplatin or vinblastine or taxol or 5FU, in particular taxol.\n22. DNA Repair Inhibitors\nDNA repair inhibitors include PARP inhibitors.\nDefinition: The term \u201cPARP inhibitor\u201d is used herein to define compounds which inhibit or modulate the activity of the family of Poly adenosine diphosphate rbose (poly(ADP-Ribose)) nuclear enzymes, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above. They may also be referred to as \u201cDNA repair inhibitors\u201d.\nBiological activity: PARP inhibitors have a role as chemosensitizing agents (for example by preventing DNA repair after anticancer therapy) and may have a role in enhancing overall patient response to anti-cancer treatments. PARP inhibitors may also act in isolation as anti cancer agents in patients whose tumours have intrinsic deficiencies in DNA repair.\nTechnical background: The PARP enzyme synthesizes poly(ADP-ribose), a branched polymer that can consists of over 200 ADP-ribose units. The protein acceptors of poly(ADP-ribose) are directly or indirectly involved in maintaining DNA integrity. They include histones, topoisomerases, DNA and RNA polymerases, DNA ligases, and Ca 2\u2032- and Mg 2, -dependent endonucleases. PARP protein is expressed at a high level in many tissues, most notably in the immune system, heart, brain and germ-line cells. Under normal physiological conditions, there is minimal PARP activity. However, DNA damage causes an immediate activation of PARP by up to 500-fold.\nPARP is activated by damaged DNA fragments and, once activated, catalyzes the attachment of up to 100 ADP-ribose units to a variety of nuclear proteins, including histones and PARP itself. It is also known that PARP inhibitors, such as 3-amino benzamide, affect overall DNA repair in response, for example, to hydrogen peroxide or ionizing radiation. The pivotal role of PARP in the repair of DNA strand breaks is well established, especially when caused directly by ionizing radiation or, indirectly after enzymatic repair of DNA lesions induced by methylating agents, especially temozolamide, topoisomerases I inhibitors and other chemotherapeutic agents as cisplatin and bleomycin. A variety of studies using knockout mice, trans-dominant inhibition models (over-expression of the DNA-binding domain), antisense and small molecular weight inhibitors have demonstrated the role of PARP in repair and cell survival after induction of DNA damage. The inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity should lead to an enhanced sensitivity of tumor cells towards DNA damaging treatments.\nPARP inhibitors have been reported to be effective in radiosensitizing (hypoxic) tumor cells and effective in preventing tumor cells from recovering from potentially lethal and sublethal damage of DNA after radiation therapy, presumably by their ability to prevent DNA strand break rejoining and by affecting several DNA damage signaling pathways. PARP inhibitors have been used to treat cancer. A recent comprehensive review of the state of the art has been published by Li and Zhang in IDrugs 2001, 4(7): 804.\nPreferences and specific embodiments: Preferred PARP inhibitors for use in accordance with the invention are selected from Bendamustine (5-[Bis(2-chloroethyl)amino]-1-methyl-2-benzimidazolebutyric acid or \u03b1-[1-Methyl-5-[bis(.beta.-chloroethyl)amino]-2-benzimidazolyl]butyric acid), available from Bayer, INO-1001 (Pardex) from Inotek Pharmaceuticals, BSI-201 from BiPar Sciences, AG-014699 from Pfizer, and ONO-2231 (N-[3-(3,4-dihydro-4-oxo-1-phthalazinyl)phenyl]-4-morpholinebutanamide methanesulfonate) from Ono Pharmaceutical.\nPosology: The PARP inhibitors are advantageously administered in daily dosages of 20-100 mg, for example 80-120 mg/m2 iv over a 30 to 60 min infusion over a 21 day cycle for Bendamustine. The key PARP inhibitor is a Pfizer product which is in phase III combination trials in metastatic melanoma. It is administered intravenously on days one thru five of a twenty-one day cycle dose?\n23. Inhibitors of G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCR)\nA preferred GPCR is Atrasentan (3-Pyrrolidinecarboxylic acid, 4-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-1-[2-(dibutylamino)-2-oxoethyl]-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-, [2R-(2.alpha., 3.beta., 4.alpha.)]-). Atrasentan, from Abbott Laboratories, is a potent and selective endothelin A receptor antagonist for the treatment of prostate tumors. There is also evidence of biological activity in other cancer types such as glioma, breast tumor, lung tumor, brain tumor, ovary tumor, colorectal tumor and renal tumor.\nPosology: Atrasentan may be advantageously administered orally in dosages of e.g. 10 mg daily.\n24. Signalling Inhibitors\nA reference to a particular signalling inhibitor herein is intended to include ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof).\nDefinition: The term \u201csignalling inhibitor\u201d (or \u201csignal transduction inhibitor\u201d) as used herein refers to signalling inhibitors or analogues of signalling inhibitors as described herein, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.\nTechnical background: A malignant tumour is the product of uncontrolled cell proliferation. Cell growth is controlled by a delicate balance between growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting factors. In normal tissue the production and activity of these factors results in differentiated cells growing in a controlled and regulated manner that maintains the normal integrity and functioning of the organ. The malignant cell has evaded this control; the natural balance is disturbed (via a variety of mechanisms) and unregulated, aberrant cell growth occurs.\nOne driver for growth is the epidermal growth factor (EGF), and the receptor for EGF (EGFR) has been implicated in the development and progression of a number of human solid tumours including those of the lung, breast, prostate, colon, ovary, head and neck. EGFR is a member of a family of four receptors, namely EGFR (HER1 or ErbB1), ErbB2 (HER2/neu), ErbB3 (HER3), and ErbB4 (HER4). These receptors are large proteins that reside in the cell membrane, each having a specific external ligand binding domain, a transmembrane domain and an internal domain which has tyrosine kinase enzyme activity. When EGF attaches to EGFR, it activates the tyrosine kinase, triggering reactions that cause the cells to grow and multiply. EGFR is found at abnormally high levels on the surface of many types of cancer cells, which may divide excessively in the presence of EGF. Inhibition of EGFR activity has therefore been a target for chemotherapeutic research in the treatment of cancer. Such inhibition can be effected by direct interference with the target EGFR on the cell surface, for example by the use of antibodies, or by inhibiting the subsequent tyrosine kinase activity.\nExamples of antibodies which target EGFR are the monoclonal antibodies trastuzumab and cetuximab. Amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein (HER 2) in primary breast carcinomas has been shown to correlate with a poor clinical prognosis for certain patients.\nTrastuzumab is a highly purified recombinant DNA-derived humanized monoclonal IgG1 kappa antibody that binds with high affinity and specificity to the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor. In vitro and in vivo preclinical studies have shown that administration of trastuzumab alone or in combination with paclitaxel or carboplatin significantly inhibits the growth of breast tumour-derived cell lines that over-express the HER2 gene product. In clinical studies trastuzumab has been shown to have clinical activity in the treatment of breast cancer. The most common adverse effects of trastuzumab are fever and chills, pain, asthenia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dyspnea, rhinitis, and insomnia. Particularly troublesome is the onset of cardiomyopathy which may be reversible in the majority of patients. Trastuzumab has been approved for the treatment of early and metastatic breast cancer, in particular metastic breast cancer, exhibiting over-expression of the HER2 protein\nCetuximab has been used for the treatment of irinotecan-refractory colorectal cancer (CRC) and in combination with radiotherapy in the treatment of head and neck cancer. It is also being evaluated both as a single agent and in combination with other agents for use in the treatment of a variety of other cancers including metastatic pancreatic carcinoma, and non-small-cell lung cancer. The administration of cetuximab can cause serious side effects, which may include difficulty in breathing and low blood pressure.\nAnother suitable monoclonal antibody for use in the combinations of the invention is panitumumab. Amgen Inc (formerly Immunex and Abgenix Inc) is developing panitumumab (ABX-EGF), a fully human monoclonal antibody against the EGF receptor, for the potential treatment of cancer, such as monotherapy for renal cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, and CRC in combination with standard chemotherapy as first-line treatment, as third-line monotherapy in advanced CRC, in particular to treat metastatic colorectal cancer (MCC) and in patients who failed standard chemotherapy. Thus ABX-EGF can be administered as a monotherapy or in association with chemotherapy and radiotherapy in order to complement independent approaches for the treatment of cancer.\nABX-EGF is a fully humanized IgG2 monoclonal antibody against the human EGFR. Fully humanized monoclonal antibodies such as ABX-EGF have several advantages over chimeric antibodies, which contain significant amounts of mouse protein. They do not generate human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA); the risk of inducing hypersensitivity reactions in patients is therefore reduced and the antibodies should demonstrate an increased in vivo lifetime. Such considerations may be important for long-term administration.\nIt can be prepared as described in WO98/50433 and process analogous thereto.\nPanitumumab may be dosed ranging from 0.01 to 5.0 mg/kg once per week, 6.0 mg/kg once every two weeks or 9.0 mg/kg once every three weeks administered by intravenous infusion.\nIn a Phase 3 pivotal study examining panitumumab as third-line monotherapy in colorectal cancer patients, patients received panitumumab every two weeks.\nThe farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib prevents signaling thru ras-mediated pathways and is under investigation for the treatment of myeloid leukemias.\nExamples of agents which target EGFR tyrosine kinase activity include the tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib. Gefitinib which has the chemical name 4-(3-chloro-4-fluoroanilino)-7-methoxy-6-(3-morpholinopropoxy)quinazoline, is used for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer. It has also been studied for other solid tumours that over-express EGF receptors such as breast and colorectal cancer. It has been found that patients receiving gefitinib may develop interstitial lung disease and eye irritation Erlotinib, which has the chemical name N-(3-ethynyl-phenyl)-6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)-4-quinazoline, has also been used for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer, and is being developed for the treatment of various other solid tumours such as pancreatic cancer, the most common side effects being rash, loss of appetite and fatigue; a more serious side effect which has been reported is interstitial lung disease.\nAnother growth factor which has received attention as a target for anticancer research is the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF is a key regulator of vasculogenesis during angiogenic processes including wound healing, retinopathy, psoriasis, inflammatory disorders, tumour growth and metastasis. Studies have shown that over-expression of VEGF is strongly associated with invasion and metastasis in human malignant disease.\nAn example of an antibody that targets the VEGF antigen on the surface of a cell is the monoclonal antibody bevacizumab which is a recombinant humanised monoclonal IgG1 antibody that binds to and inhibits VEGF. Bevacizumab has been used for the treatment of colorectal cancer, for example in combination with chemotherapy e.g. 5-fluorouracil. Bevacizumab also being developed as a potential treatment for other solid tumours such as metastatic breast cancer, metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma. The most serious adverse events associated with bevacizumab include gastrointestinal perforations, hypertensive crises, nephrotic syndrome and congestive heart failure. Other therapeutic agents in development which target the action of VEGF at alternate points in the signal transduction cascade intiated by this growth factor include sunitinib which is marketed under the trade name Sutent by Sugen/Pfizer and inhibits the kinase activity of the VEGF receptor. Sutent has demonstrated efficacy in Phase III trials in gastrointestinal stromal tumours and has regulatory approval for the treatment of renal cancer.\nAnother growth factor of importance in tumour development is the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) that comprises a family of peptide growth factors that signal through cell surface tyrosine kinase receptors (PDGFR) and stimulate various cellular functions including growth, proliferation, and differentiation. PDGF expression has been demonstrated in a number of different solid tumours including glioblastomas and prostate carcinomas. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate, which has the chemical name 4-[(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)methyl]-N-[4-methyl-3-[[4-(3-pyridinyl)-2-ylpyridinyl]amino]-phenyl]benzamide methanesulfonate, blocks activity of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein and the cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor c-Kit, and as such is approved for the treatment on chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumours. Imatinib mesylate is also a potent inhibitor of PDGFR kinase and is currently being evaluated for the treatment of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and glioblastoma multiforme, based upon evidence in these diseases of activating mutations in PDGFR. The most frequently reported drug-related adverse events were edema, nausea, vomiting, cramps and musculosketetal pain.\nA further growth factor target for cancer chemotherapy is inhibition of Raf which is a key enzyme in the chain reaction of the body's chemistry that triggers cell growth. Abnormal activation of this pathway is a common factor in the development of most cancers, including two-thirds of melanomas. By blocking the action of Raf kinase, it may be possible to reverse the progression of these tumours. One such inhibitor is sorafenib (a.k.a. BAY 43-9006 and Nexavar) which has the chemical name 4-(4-(3-(4-chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)ureido)phenoxy)-N2-methylpyridine-2-carboxamide. Sorafenib targets both the Raf signalling pathway to inhibit cell proliferation and the VEGFR/PDGFR signalling cascades to inhibit tumour angiogenesis. Raf kinase is a specific enzyme in the Ras pathway. Mutations in the Ras gene occur in approximately 20 percent of all human cancers, including 90 percent of pancreatic cancers, 50 percent of colon cancers and 30 percent of non-small cell lung cancers. Sorafenib is being investigated for the treatment of a number of cancers including liver and kidney cancer. The most common side effects of sorafenib are pain, swelling, redness of the hands and/or feet, and also rash, fatigue and diarrhea.\nBiological activity: The signalling inhibitors of the combinations of the invention are specific inhibitors of cell signalling proteins as described above and have activity against various cancers. Combinations of a compound of formula I with signalling inhibitors may be beneficial in the treatment and diagnosis of many types of cancer. Combination with a molecularly targeted agent such as a signalling inhibitor (e.g. Iressa, Avastin, herceptin, or Gleevec\u2122) would find particular application in relation to cancers which express or have activated the relevant molecular target such as EGF receptor, VEGF receptor, ErbB2, BCRabl, c-kit, PDGF. Diagnosis of such tumours could be performed using techniques known to a person skilled in the art and as described herein such as RTPCR and FISH.\nProblems: There is a need to increase the inhibitory efficacy of signalling inhibitors against tumour growth and also to provide a means for the use of lower dosages of signaling inhibitors to reduce the potential for adverse toxic side effects to the patient.\nPreferences: Preferred signalling inhibitors for use in accordance with the invention include antibodies targeting EGFR such as monoclonal antibodies trastuzumab and cetuximab, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib and erlotinib, VEGF targeting antibodies such as bevacizumab and sunitinib, PDGFR inhibitors such as imatinib mesylate and Raf inhibitors such as sorafenib, as referred to herein.

In other embodiments the signalling inhibitor is selected from trastuzumab, cetuximab, pantumab, gefitinib, erlotinib, bevacizumab, imatinib mesylate, sunitinib and sorafenib.\nFurther combinations of the invention include the following signalling inhibitors: dasatinib, lapatinib, nilotinib, vandetanib, vatalinib and CHIR-258, in particular dasatinib, lapatinib, nilotinib, vandetanib and vatalinib.\nBMS is developing dasatinib (Sprycel or BMS-354825) an oral multitargeted kinase inhibitor, for the potential twice-daily treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and solid tumors. The drug is also under investigation for multiple myeloma (MM) and other hematologic malignancies. Dasatanib has proved effective in Ph+ CML and AML in clinical trials given twice daily at 50-90 mg and also in imatinib resistant patients. Thrombocytopenia and neutropenia were amongst the side effects observed during clinical evaluation of dasatinib.\nThe structure of dasatinib, a Src/Abl kinase inhibitor is below:\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nDasatinib can be prepared by processes described in or analogous to WO 00/062778, WO 2005/076990 and WO 2005/077945.\nNovartis is developing nilotinib (AMN-107), an orally available signal transduction inhibitor that targets BCR-ABL, c-kit and PDGF, for the potential treatment of leukemias. The compound is being investigated for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), systemic mastocytosis or chronic eosinophilic leukemia (hypereosinophilic syndrome), refractory gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). Adverse events included hematological adverse events, headache, fatigue, muscle spasms, and nausea and vomiting. In early clinical studies doses of the order of 400 mg given twice daily have proved effective in treating CML, AML and ALL\nThe structure of nilotinib is shown below. It can be prepared as described in or analogous to as described in WO 2004/005281 and WO 2005/049032.\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nVatalanib (PTK787/ZK222584) is a VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase angiogenesis inhibitor, under development by Novartis AG (formerly Ciba-Geigy) and Schering AG, for the potential treatment of colorectal cancer. The compound entered trials for colorectal cancer, the first- and second-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (untreated and pretreated metastatic colorectal patients). Schering and Novartis are also investigating vatalanib in other solid tumors e.g. non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as a second-line monotherapy in patients with stage IIIb/IV disease who had relapsed or were refractory to first-line therapy, renal cell cancer and glioblastoma, and potentially prostate, ovarian, breast, pancreas and small cell lung cancers. In addition vatalanib is also investigated for wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Vatalanib has been evaluated at doses up to 1,250 mg daily in clinical studies. Adverse events include nausea/vomiting, fatigue, ataxia, lethargy, hypertension, headache, dizziness, diarrhoea, hypertension as well as syncope and neurotoxicity.\nVatalinib (structure shown below) can be prepared as described in or analogues to as described in WO 98/35958\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nLapatinib ditosylate (Tykerb or GW2016 /572016), an ErbB2 and EGFR dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is being developed by GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK) for the potential treatment of solid tumors.\nIt is under investigation for various tumors including breast, lung, stomach, bladder and head and neck cancers, in particular for the treatment of patients with refractory advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose tumours express HER-2 and who have failed previous therapies both as a single agent and in combination with other therapies including capecitabine and paclitaxel. The compound had also entered trials for renal cell cancer, advanced and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and in the treatment of brain metastases associated with breast cancer. In early clinical evaluation Lapatinib has been evaluated on a twice daily and once daily schedule at doses over the range 500-1500 mg and at doses of 750-1250 mg given twice daily.

It is one of a series of inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor tyrosine kinase) that also has activity against the EGF and RET receptor tyrosine kinases. Clinical studies have investigated doses of vandetanib in the region of 100-300 mg daily as monotherapy and in combinations. Common adverse effects observed were rash, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, asymptomatic QTc prolongation\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nZD-6474 can be prepared as described in WO 01/32651 and processes analogous therein.\nCHIR-258 (GFKI-258; structure shown), is a potent VEGF, FGF and PDGF receptor kinase inhibitor, for the potential oral treatment of various types of cancer. Novartis (formerly Chiron), had initiated a study in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients and multiple myeloma (MM).\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nCHIR-258 can be prepared as described in WO 02/22598 and WO 2005/046590 and processes analogous therein.\nAnother suitable signalling inhibitor for use in the combinations of the invention is axitinib (AG-013736). Pfizer is developing axitinib (AG-13736, AG-013736), an oral inhibitor of the VEGF, PDGF and CSF-1 receptor tyrosine kinases which was discovered by Pfizer's wholly-owned subsidiary Agouron Pharmaceuticals, as an anti-angiogenic agent for the potential treatment of cancer. It is being studied for breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, and carcinomas. The compound has also being investigated for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nIt can be prepared as described in WO 2004/087152, WO 2006/048746 and WO 2006/048745 and process analogous thereto. Axitinib may be dosed at 5 mg PO BID.\nPosology: With regard to the EGFR antibodies, these are generally administered in a dosage of 1 to 500 mg per square meter (mg/m2) of body surface area, trastuzumab being advantageously administered in a dosage of 1 to 5 mg/m2 of body surface area, particularly 2 to 4 mg/m2; cetuxumab is advantageously administered in a dosage of about 200 to 400 mg/m2, preferably about 250 mg/m2.\nWith regard to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, these are generally administered in a daily oral dosage of 100 to 500 mg, for example gefitinib in a dosage of about 250 mg and erlotinib in a dosage of about 150 mg.\nWith regard to the VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab, this is generally administered in a dosage of about 1 to 10 mg/kg for example about 5 mg/kg.\nWith regard to the PDGF inhibitor imatinib, this is generally administered in a dosage of about 400 to 800 mg per day preferably about 400 mg per day.\nWith regard to the Raf inhibitor sorafenib, this is administered at a dose of 800 mg daily.\nThese dosages may be administered for example once, twice or more per course of treatment, which may be repeated for example every 7, 14, 21 or 28 days.\nPKA/B Inhibitors and PKB Pathway Inhibitors\nAnother preferred class of signaling inhibitor for use in the combinations of the invention are PKA/B inhibitors and PKB pathway inhibitors.\nPKB pathway inhibitors are those that inhibit the activation of PKB, the activity of the kinase itself or modulate downstream targets, blocking the proliferative and cell survival effects of the pathway. Target enzymes in the pathway include phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase (PI3K), PKB itself, mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR), PDK-1 and p70 S6 kinase and forkhead translocation factor. Several components of the PI 3-kinase/PKB/PTEN pathway are implicated in oncogenesis. In addition to growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases, integrin-dependent cell adhesion and G-protein coupled receptors activate PI 3-kinase both directly and indirectly through adaptor molecules. Functional loss of PTEN (the most commonly mutated tumour-suppressor gene in cancer after p53), oncogenic mutations in PI 3-kinase, amplification of PI 3-kinase and overexpression of PKB have been established in many malignancies. In addition, persistent signaling through the PI 3-kinase/PKB pathway by stimulation of the insulin-like growth factor receptor is a mechanism of resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors.\nThe discovery of non-random, somatic mutations in the gene encoding p110\u03b1 in a range of human tumours suggests an oncogenic role for the mutated PI 3-kinase enzyme (Samuels, et al., Science, 304 554, April 2004). Mutations in p110\u03b1 have since been detected in the following human tumours: colon (32%), hepatocellular (36%) and endometroid and clear cell cancer (20%). p110\u03b1 is now the most commonly mutated gene in breast tumours (25-40%). Forkhead family translocations often occur in acute leukemia.\nThe PI 3-kinase/PKB/PTEN pathway is thus an attractive target for cancer drug development since such agents would inhibit proliferation and surmount resistance to cytotoxic agents in cancer cells.\nExamples of PKB pathway inhibitors include PI3K Inhibitors such as Semaphore, SF1126 and MTOR inhibitors such as Rapamycin Analogues. RAD 001 (everolimus) from Novartis is an orally available derivative of the compound rapamycin. The compound is a novel macrolide, which is being developed as an antiproliferative drug with applications as an immunosuppressant and anticancer agent. RAD001 exerts its activity on growth-factor dependent proliferation of cells through its high affinity for an intracellular receptor protein, FKBP-12. The resulting FKBP-12/RAD001 complex then binds with mTOR to inhibit downstream signaling events. The compound is currently in clinical development for a wide variety of oncology indications. CCI 779 (temsirolemus) from Wyeth Pharmaceuticals and AP23573 from Ariad Pharmaceuticals are also rapamycin analogues. AP23841 and AP23573 from Ariad Pharmaceutical also target mTOR. Calmodulin inhibitors from Harvard are forkhead translocation inhibitors. (Nature Reviews drug discovery, Exploiting the PI3K/AKT Pathway for Cancer Drug Discovery; Bryan T. Hennessy, Debra L.

KRX-0401 has been evaluated in phase 1 studies as a potential oral anticancer drug. Dose limiting toxicities included nausea, vomiting and fatigue. Gastrointestinal toxicities increased at higher doses. A phase II trial in refractory sarcoma is planned.\nAPI-2/TCN is a small molecule inhibitor of PKB signaling pathway in tumour cells. Phase I and II clinical trials of API-2/TCN have been conducted on advanced tumours. API-2/TCN exhibited some side effects, which include hepatotoxicity, hypertriglyceridemia, thrombocytopenia, and hyperglycemia.\nRX-0201 is being developed as an AKT protein kinase inhibitor for the treatment of solid tumours. In July 2004, a phase I trial was initiated in patients with advanced malignancies. Data from this showed RX-0201 inhibited overexpression of Akt and suppressed cancer growth in brain, breast, cervix, liver, lung, ovary, prostate and stomach tumours, and was well tolerated. By March 2005, US Orphan Drug status had been granted to RX-0201 for several solid tumour types.\nEnzastaurin HCl (LY317615) suppresses angiogenesis and was advanced for clinical development based upon anti-angiogenic activity. It is described as a selective PKC\u03b2 inhibitor. It also has a direct anti-tumour effect, and suppresses GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation. It is currently being investigated for the treatment of glioma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\nSR-13668 is claimed to be an orally active specific AKT inhibitor that significantly inhibits phospho-AKT in breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. In vivo assessment in mice showed no adverse effects at doses 10 times more than were needed for antitumour activity.\nPX-316 is a D-3-deoxy-phosphatidyl-myo-inositol that binds to the PH domain of PKB, trapping it in the cytoplasm and thus preventing PKB activation. Anti-tumour activity was seen in early xenografts and was well tolerated.\nAllosteric, selective inhibitors of PKB based on a 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline core or a 5,6-diphenylpyrazin-2(1H)-one core have been developed (Merck).\nKRX-0401: In a Phase I weekly dosing study conducted in Europe, the recommended Phase II dose was 600/mg/week. Subsequent studies conducted in the U.S. have shown that much higher doses are well tolerated when the doses are divided and administered at 4 to 6 hour intervals. In addition, it has been shown that KRX-0401 has a very long half-life in the range of 100 hours. This makes the possibility of a relative non-toxic, intermittent dosing schedule very plausible.\nA phase I trial of API-2 was conducted using a 5-day continuous infusion schedule. Dose levels ranged from 10 mg/sq m/day\u00d75 days to 40 mg/sq m/day\u00d75 days. Initially, courses were repeated every 3 to 4 weeks. As cumulative toxicity became manifested, the interval between courses was changed to every 6 weeks. Recommended schedule for Phase II studies is 20 mg/sq m/day for 5 days every 6 weeks. A Phase II trial of TCN-P was conducted in metastatic or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix using a 5-day continuous infusion schedule. The starting dose was 35 mg/m2\u00d75 days and courses were repeated every 6 weeks.\nFurther PKB inhibitors include Perifosine from Keryx Biopharmaceuticals. Perifosine is an oral Akt inhibitor which exerts a marked cytotoxic effect on human tumour cell lines, and is currently being tested in several phase II trials for treatment of major human cancers. KRX-0401 (Perifosine/NSC 639966) has the structure:\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nIt can be prepared according to Aste Medica patent publication DE4222910 or Xenoport patent publication US2003171303.\nAPI-2/TCN (Triciribine) has the structure:\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nIt can be prepared according to Bodor patent publication WO9200988 or Ribapharm patent publication WO2003061385.\nEnzastaurin hydrochloride has the structure:\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nIt can be prepared according to Eli Lilly patent publication WO2004006928.\nSR 13668 has the structure:\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nIt can be prepared according to SRI International patent publication US2004043965.\nNL-71-101 has the structure:\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nIt can be prepared according to Biochemistry (2002), 41(32), 10304-10314 or Peptor patent publication WO2001091754.\nDeveloGen (formerly Peptor) is investigating NL-71-101, a protein kinase B (PKB) inhibitor, for the potential treatment of cancer [466579], [539004].

Particular examples of such agents include anti-emetic agents and agents that prevent or decrease the duration of chemotherapy-associated neutropenia and prevent complications that arise from reduced levels of red blood cells or white blood cells, for example erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF).\nThus, the present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions, as defined above, and methods of making a pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing at least one active compound, as defined above, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, buffers, adjuvants, stabilizers, or other materials, as described herein.\nThe term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d as used herein pertains to compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of a subject (e.g. human) without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Each carrier, excipient, etc. must also be \u201cacceptable\u201d in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation.\nAccordingly, in a further aspect, the invention provides combinations as defined herein in the form of pharmaceutical compositions.\nThe pharmaceutical compositions can be in any form suitable for oral, parenteral, topical, intranasal, ophthalmic, otic, rectal, intra-vaginal, or transdermal administration. Where the compositions are intended for parenteral administration, they can be formulated for intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous administration or for direct delivery into a target organ or tissue by injection, infusion or other means of delivery. The delivery can be by bolus injection, short term infusion or longer term infusion and can be via passive delivery or through the utilisation of a suitable infusion pump.\nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, co-solvents, organic solvent mixtures, cyclodextrin complexation agents, emulsifying agents (for forming and stabilizing emulsion formulations), liposome components for forming liposomes, gellable polymers for forming polymeric gels, lyophilisation protectants and combinations of agents for, inter alia, stabilising the active ingredient in a soluble form and rendering the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration may also take the form of aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents (R. G. Strickly, Solubilizing Excipients in oral and injectable formulations, Pharmaceutical Research, Vol 21(2) 2004, p 201-230).\nA drug molecule that is ionizable can be solubilized to the desired concentration by pH adjustment if the drug's pKa is sufficiently away from the formulation pH value. The acceptable range is pH 2-12 for intravenous and intramuscular administration, but subcutaneously the range is pH 2.7-9.0. The solution pH is controlled by either the salt form of the drug, strong acids/bases such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide, or by solutions of buffers which include but are not limited to buffering solutions formed from glycine, citrate, acetate, maleate, succinate, histidine, phosphate, tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane (TRIS), or carbonate.\nThe combination of an aqueous solution and a water-soluble organic solvent/surfactant (i.e., a cosolvent) is often used in injectable formulations. The water-soluble organic solvents and surfactants used in injectable formulations include but are not limited to propylene glycol, ethanol, polyethylene glycol 300, polyethylene glycol 400, glycerin, dimethylacetamide (DMA), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP; Pharmasolve), dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO), Solutol HS 15, Cremophor EL, Cremophor RH 60, and polysorbate 80. Such formulations can usually be, but are not always, diluted prior to injection.\nPropylene glycol, PEG 300, ethanol, Cremophor EL, Cremophor RH 60, and polysorbate 80 are the entirely organic water-miscible solvents and surfactants used in commercially available injectable formulations and can be used in combinations with each other. The resulting organic formulations are usually diluted at least 2-fold prior to IV bolus or IV infusion.\nAlternatively increased water solubility can be achieved through molecular complexation with cyclodextrins.\nLiposomes are closed spherical vesicles composed of outer lipid bilayer membranes and an inner aqueous core and with an overall diameter of <100 \u03bcm. Depending on the level of hydrophobicity, moderately hydrophobic drugs can be solubilized by liposomes if the drug becomes encapsulated or intercalated within the liposome. Hydrophobic drugs can also be solubilized by liposomes if the drug molecule becomes an integral part of the lipid bilayer membrane, and in this case, the hydrophobic drug is dissolved in the lipid portion of the lipid bilayer. A typical liposome formulation contains water with phospholipid at 5-20 mg/ml, an isotonicifier, a pH 5-8 buffer, and optionally cholesterol.\nThe formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilised) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use.\nThe pharmaceutical formulation can be prepared by lyophilising one or more of the constituent component(s) (or salt thereof) of the combination. Lyophilisation refers to the procedure of freeze-drying a composition. Freeze-drying and lyophilisation are therefore used herein as synonyms. A typical process is to solubilise the compound(s) and the resulting formulation is clarified, sterile filtered and aseptically transferred to containers appropriate for lyophilisation (e.g. vials). In the case of vials, they are partially stoppered with lyo-stoppers. The formulation can be cooled to freezing and subjected to lyophilisation under standard conditions and then hermetically capped forming a stable, dry lyophile formulation. The composition will typically have a low residual water content, e.g. less than 5% e.g. less than 1% by weight based on weight of the lyophile.\nThe lyophilisation formulation may contain other excipients for example, thickening agents, dispersing agents, buffers, antioxidants, preservatives, and tonicity adjusters. Typical buffers include phosphate, acetate, citrate and glycine. Examples of antioxidants include ascorbic acid, sodium bisulphite, sodium metabisulphite, monothioglycerol, thiourea, butylated hydroxytoluene, butylated hydroxyl anisole, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid salts. Preservatives may include benzoic acid and its salts, sorbic acid and its salts, alkyl esters of para-hydroxybenzoic acid, phenol, chlorobutanol, benzyl alcohol, thimerosal, benzalkonium chloride and cetylpyridinium chloride. The buffers mentioned previously, as well as dextrose and sodium chloride, can be used for tonicity adjustment if necessary.\nBulking agents are generally used in lyophilisation technology for facilitating the process and/or providing bulk and/or mechanical integrity to the lyophilized cake. Bulking agent means a freely water soluble, solid particulate diluent that when co-lyophilised with the compound or salt thereof, provides a physically stable lyophilized cake, a more optimal freeze-drying process and rapid and complete reconstitution. The bulking agent may also be utilised to make the solution isotonic.\nThe water-soluble bulking agent can be any of the pharmaceutically acceptable inert solid materials typically used for lyophilisation. Such bulking agents include, for example, sugars such as glucose, maltose, sucrose, and lactose; polyalcohols such as sorbitol or mannitol; amino acids such as glycine; polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidine; and polysaccharides such as dextran.\nThe ratio of the weight of the bulking agent to the weight of active compound is typically within the range from about 1 to about 5, for example of about 1 to about 3, e.g. in the range of about 1 to 2.\nAlternatively they can be provided in a solution form which may be concentrated and sealed in a suitable vial. Sterilisation of dosage forms may be via filtration or by autoclaving of the vials and their contents at appropriate stages of the formulation process. The supplied formulation may require further dilution or preparation before delivery for example dilution into suitable sterile infusion packs.\nExtemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets.\nIn one preferred embodiment of the invention, the pharmaceutical composition is in a form suitable for i.v. administration, for example by injection or infusion.\nIn another preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is in a form suitable for sub-cutaneous (s.c.) administration.\nPharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for oral administration include tablets, capsules, caplets, pills, lozenges, syrups, solutions, powders, granules, elixirs and suspensions, sublingual tablets, wafers or patches and buccal patches.\nPharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be formulated in accordance with known techniques, see for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., USA.\nThus, tablet compositions can contain a unit dosage of active compound together with an inert diluent or carrier such as a sugar or sugar alcohol, e.g.; lactose, sucrose, sorbitol or mannitol; and/or a non-sugar derived diluent such as sodium carbonate, calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, or a cellulose or derivative thereof such as methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, and starches such as corn starch. Tablets may also contain such standard ingredients as binding and granulating agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, disintegrants (e.g. swellable crosslinked polymers such as crosslinked carboxymethylcellulose), lubricating agents (e.g. stearates), preservatives (e.g. parabens), antioxidants (e.g. BHT), buffering agents (for example phosphate or citrate buffers), and effervescent agents such as citrate/bicarbonate mixtures. Such excipients are well known and do not need to be discussed in detail here.\nCapsule formulations may be of the hard gelatin or soft gelatin variety and can contain the active component in solid, semi-solid, or liquid form. Gelatin capsules can be formed from animal gelatin or synthetic or plant derived equivalents thereof.\nThe solid dosage forms (e.g.; tablets, capsules etc.) can be coated or un-coated, but typically have a coating, for example a protective film coating (e.g. a wax or varnish) or a release controlling coating. The coating (e.g. a Eudragit\u2122 type polymer) can be designed to release the active component at a desired location within the gastro-intestinal tract. Thus, the coating can be selected so as to degrade under certain pH conditions within the gastrointestinal tract, thereby selectively release the compound in the stomach or in the ileum or duodenum. Alternatively or additionally, the coating can be used as a taste masking agent to mask unpleasant tastes such as bitter tasting drugs. The coating may contain sugar or other agents that assist in masking unpleasant tastes.\nInstead of, or in addition to, a coating, the drug can be presented in a solid matrix comprising a release controlling agent, for example a release delaying agent which may be adapted to selectively release the compound under conditions of varying acidity or alkalinity in the gastrointestinal tract. Alternatively, the matrix material or release retarding coating can take the form of an erodible polymer (e.g. a maleic anhydride polymer) which is substantially continuously eroded as the dosage form passes through the gastrointestinal tract. As a further alternative, the active compound can be formulated in a delivery system that provides osmotic control of the release of the compound. Osmotic release and other delayed release or sustained release formulations may be prepared in accordance with methods well known to those skilled in the art.\nThe pharmaceutical formulations may be presented to a patient in \u201cpatient packs\u201d containing an entire course of treatment in a single package, usually a blister pack. Patient packs have an advantage over traditional prescriptions, where a pharmacist divides a patient's supply of a pharmaceutical from a bulk supply, in that the patient always has access to the package insert contained in the patient pack, normally missing in patient prescriptions. The inclusion of a package insert has been shown to improve patient compliance with the physician's instructions.\nCompositions for topical use include ointments, creams, sprays, patches, gels, liquid drops and inserts (for example intraocular inserts). Such compositions can be formulated in accordance with known methods.\nCompositions for parenteral administration are typically presented as sterile aqueous or oily solutions or fine suspensions, or may be provided in finely divided sterile powder form for making up extemporaneously with sterile water for injection.\nExamples of formulations for rectal or intra-vaginal administration include pessaries and suppositories which may be, for example, formed from a shaped mouldable or waxy material containing the active compound. Thus, unit-dose suppositories or pessaries may be prepared by admixture of the active ingredient with one or more conventional solid carriers, for example coca butter, and shaping the resulting mixture. Further examples of mouldable waxy materials include polymers such as high molecular weight polyalkylene glycols, e.g. high molecular weight polyethylene glycols.\nAlternatively, in the case of vaginal administration, the formulation may be presented as a tampon impregnated with the active ingredients and optionally one or more excipients or diluents. Other formulations suitable for rectal and vaginal administration include creams, gels, foams, pastes and sprays.\nFurther examples of topical compositions include dressings such as bandages and adhesive plasters impregnated with active ingredients and optionally one or more excipients or diluents. Carriers which may be used include e.g. polyhydric alcohols such as polyethylene glycols, propylene glycol or glycerol. Suitable excipients are those known in the art to be appropriate.\nCompositions for administration by inhalation may take the form of inhalable powder compositions or liquid or powder sprays, and can be administrated in standard form using powder inhaler devices or aerosol dispensing devices. Such devices are well known. For administration by inhalation, the powdered formulations typically comprise the active compound together with an inert solid powdered diluent such as lactose.\nThe combination of the invention and/or its constituent compounds will generally be presented in unit dosage form and, as such, will typically contain sufficient compound to provide a desired level of biological activity. For example, a formulation may contain from 1 nanogram to 2 grams of active ingredient, e.g. from 1 nanogram to 2 milligrams of active ingredient. Within this range, particular sub-ranges of compound are 0.1 milligrams to 2 grams of active ingredient (more usually from 10 milligrams to 1 gram, e.g. 50 milligrams to 500 milligrams), or 1 microgram to 20 milligrams (for example 1 microgram to 10 milligrams, e.g. 0.1 milligrams to 2 milligrams of active ingredient).\nFor oral compositions, a unit dosage form may contain from 1 milligram to 2 grams, more typically 10 milligrams to 1 gram, for example 50 milligrams to 1 gram, e.g. 100 milligrams to 1 gram, of active compound.\nThe active compound will be administered to a patient in need thereof (for example a human or animal patient) in an amount sufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic effect.\nMethods of Treatment\nThe combinations of the invention will be useful in the prophylaxis or treatment of a range of disease states or conditions mediated by Hsp90 client proteins. Examples of such disease states and conditions are set out above.\nThe combinations are generally administered to a subject in need of such administration, for example a human or animal patient, preferably a human.\nThe combination will typically be administered in amounts that are therapeutically or prophylactically useful and which generally are non-toxic. However, in certain situations (for example in the case of life threatening diseases), the benefits of administering a combination of the invention may outweigh the disadvantages of any toxic effects or side effects, in which case it may be considered desirable to administer the combinations in amounts that are associated with a degree of toxicity.\nThe combinations may be administered over a prolonged term to maintain beneficial therapeutic effects or may be administered for a short period only. Alternatively they may be administered in a continuous manner or in a manner that provides persistent intermittent dosing (e.g. a pulsatile manner).\nA typical daily dose can be in the range from 100 picograms to 100 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, more typically 5 nanograms to 25 milligrams per kilogram of bodyweight, and more usually 10 nanograms to 15 milligrams per kilogram (e.g. 10 nanograms to 10 milligrams, and more typically 1 microgram per kilogram to 20 milligrams per kilogram, for example 1 microgram to 10 milligrams per kilogram) per kilogram of bodyweight although higher or lower doses may be administered where required. Administration can be on a daily basis or on a repeat basis every 2, or 3, or 4, or 5, or 6, or 7, or 10 or 14, or 21, or 28 days for example.\nIn one particular dosing schedule, a patient will be given an infusion for periods of one hour to 4 hours daily for up to ten days in particular up to two days for one week, every two weeks in three, and the treatment repeated at a desired interval such as three to six weeks, in particular every three weeks.\nMore particularly, a patient may be given an infusion for periods of one hour daily twice a week for two weeks in three weeks and the treatment repeated every three weeks.\nAlternatively, a patient may be given an infusion for periods of one hour daily twice a week for three weeks in four weeks and the treatment repeated every four weeks.\nIn another particular dosing schedule, a patient will be given an infusion for periods of one hour daily for up to ten days in particular up to five days for one week, and the treatment repeated at a desired interval such as two to four weeks, in particular every three weeks.\nMore particularly, a patient may be given an infusion for periods of one hour daily for 5 days and the treatment repeated every three weeks.\nIn another particular dosing schedule, a patient is given an infusion over 30 minutes to 1 hour followed by maintenance infusions of variable duration, for example 1 to 5 hours, e.g. 3 hours.\nIn a further particular dosing schedule, a patient is given a continuous infusion for a period of 12 hours to 5 days, an in particular a continuous infusion of 24 hours to 72 hours.\nUltimately, however, the quantity administered and the type of composition used will be commensurate with the nature of the disease or physiological condition being treated and will be at the discretion of the physician.\nThe combinations as defined herein can be administered as the sole therapeutic agent or they can be administered in combination therapy with one of more other compounds for treatment of a particular disease state, for example a neoplastic disease such as a cancer as hereinbefore defined. Examples of such compounds are set out in the section headed \u201coptional auxiliary compounds for use according to the invention\u201d, above.\nExamples of other therapeutic agents or treatments that may be administered together (whether concurrently or at different time intervals) with the combinations of the invention include but are not limited to:\n    Topoisomerase I inhibitors Antimetabolites Tubulin targeting agents DNA binder and topoisomerase II inhibitors Alkylating Agents Monoclonal Antibodies Anti-Hormones Signal Transduction Inhibitors Proteasome Inhibitors DNA methyl transferases Cytokines and retinoids Chromatin targeted therapies, e.g. HDAC or HAT modulators Radiotherapy; and Other therapeutic or prophylactic agents; for example agents that reduce or alleviate some of the side effects associated with chemotherapy. Particular examples of such agents include anti-emetic agents and agents that prevent or decrease the duration of chemotherapy-associated neutropenia and prevent complications that arise from reduced levels of red blood cells or white blood cells, for example erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Also included are agents that inhibit bone resorption such as bisphosphonate agents e.g. zoledronate, pamidronate and ibandronate, agents that suppress inflammatory responses (such as dexamethazone, prednisone, and prednisolone) and agents used to reduce blood levels of growth hormone and IGF-I in acromegaly patients such as synthetic forms of the brain hormone somatostatin, which includes octreotide acetate which is a long-acting octapeptide with pharmacologic properties mimicking those of the natural hormone somatostatin. Further included are agents such as leucovorin, which is used as an antidote to drugs that decrease levels of folic acid, or folinic acid itself and agents such as megestrol acetate which can be used for the treatment of side-effects including oedema and thromboembolic episodes.   \nFor the case of Hsp90 inhibitors combined with other therapies, the two or more treatments may be given in individually varying dose schedules and via different routes.\nWhere the combination is administered with one, two, three, four or more other therapeutic agents (preferably one or two, more preferably one), the components can be administered simultaneously or sequentially. When administered sequentially, they can be administered at closely spaced intervals (for example over a period of 5-10 minutes) or at longer intervals (for example 1, 2, 3, 4 or more hours apart, or even longer periods apart where required), the precise dosage regimen being commensurate with the properties of the therapeutic agent(s).\nThe combinations of the invention may also be administered in conjunction with non-chemotherapeutic treatments such as radiotherapy, photodynamic therapy, gene therapy; surgery and controlled diets.\nFor use in combination therapy with another chemotherapeutic agent, the combination and one, two, three, four or more other therapeutic agents can be, for example, formulated together in a dosage form containing two, three, four or more therapeutic agents. In an alternative, the individual therapeutic agents may be formulated separately and presented together in the form of a kit, optionally with instructions for their use.\nA person skilled in the art would know through his or her common general knowledge the dosing regimes and combination therapies to use.\nMethods of Diagnosis\nPrior to administration of a combination comprising a compound of formula (I), a patient may be screened to determine whether a disease or condition from which the patient is or may be suffering is one which would be susceptible to treatment with a compound having activity against Hsp90.\nFor example, a biological sample taken from a patient may be analysed to determine whether a condition or disease, such as cancer, that the patient is or may be suffering from is one which is characterised by a genetic abnormality or abnormal protein expression which leads to the mutation or over-activation of an Hsp90 client protein. Examples of such abnormalities that result in activation of Hsp90 client proteins include; Bcr-ABL translocation, Flt-3 internal duplication, and mutation of Braf, or over-expression of ErbB2.\nThus, the patient may be subjected to a diagnostic test to detect a marker characteristic of up-regulation. The term diagnosis includes screening. By marker we include genetic markers including, for example, the measurement of DNA composition to identify mutations of Braf, BCR-abl, and Flt3 or other affected client proteins. The term marker also includes proteins such as ErbB2, including levels or concentrations of the protein or some fragments or degradation product and for enzymes the enzymic activity. The protein (e.g. phosphorylated or not) and mRNA levels of the aforementioned proteins could also be assessed to characterise a change in activity. For example the level of phosphorylated AKT can be an indicator of sensitivity to HSP90 inhibitors\nThe diagnostic tests are typically conducted on a biological sample selected from for example tumour biopsy samples, blood samples (isolation and enrichment of shed tumour cells), stool biopsies, sputum, chromosome analysis, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, buccal spears or biopsy or from urine.\nThe screening process will typically involve direct sequencing, oligonucleotide or protein microarray analysis, proteomic analysis by mass spectrometry, immunohistochemical techniques or detection using a specific antibody.\nMethods of identification and analysis of mutations and up-regulation of proteins are well known to a person skilled in the art. Screening methods could include, but are not limited to, standard methods such as reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), in-situ hybridisation or immunoblotting.\nIn screening by RT-PCR, the level of mRNA in the tumour is assessed by creating a cDNA copy of the mRNA followed by amplification of the cDNA by PCR. Methods of PCR amplification, the selection of primers, and conditions for amplification, are known to a person skilled in the art. Nucleic acid manipulations and PCR are carried out by standard methods, as described for example in Ausubel, F. M. et al., eds. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 2004, John Wiley & Sons Inc., or Innis, M. A. et-al., eds. PCR Protocols: a guide to methods and applications, 1990, Academic Press, San Diego. Reactions and manipulations involving nucleic acid techniques are also described in Sambrook et al., 2001, 3rd Ed, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. Alternatively a commercially available kit for RT-PCR (for example Roche Molecular Biochemicals) may be used, or methodology as set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,666,828; 4,683,202; 4,801,531; 5,192,659, 5,272,057, 5,882,864, and 6,218,529 and incorporated herein by reference.\nAn example of an in-situ hybridisation technique for assessing mRNA expression would be fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) (see Angerer, 1987 Meth. Enzymol., 152: 649).\nGenerally, in situ hybridization comprises the following major steps: (1) fixation of tissue to be analyzed; (2) prehybridization treatment of the sample to increase accessibility of target nucleic acid, and to reduce non-specific binding; (3) hybridization of the mixture of nucleic acids to the nucleic acid in the biological structure or tissue; (4) post-hybridization washes to remove nucleic acid fragments not bound in the hybridization, and (5) detection of the hybridized nucleic acid fragments. The probes used in such applications are typically labelled, for example, with radioisotopes or fluorescent reporters. Preferred probes are sufficiently long, for example, from about 50, 100, or 200 nucleotides to about 1000 or more nucleotides, to enable specific hybridization with the target nucleic acid(s) under stringent conditions. Commercially available FISH probes also exist for cytogenetic detection of chromosome rearrangements, which can be used to detect Flt3 and Bcr-Abl translocations within leukaemia cell populations. Standard methods for carrying out FISH are described in Ausubel, F. M. et al., eds. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 2004, John Wiley & Sons Inc and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization: Technical Overview by John M. S. Bartlett in Molecular Diagnosis of Cancer, Methods and Protocols, 2nd ed.; ISBN: 1-59259-760-2; March 2004, pps. 077-088; Series: Methods in Molecular Medicine.\nMethods for gene expression profiling are described by (DePrimo et al., BMC Cancer 2003, 3:3). Briefly, the protocol is as follows: double-stranded cDNA is synthesized from total RNA Using a (dT)24 oligomer for priming first-strand cDNA synthesis, followed by second strand cDNA synthesis with random hexamer primers. The double-stranded cDNA is used as a template for in vitro transcription of cRNA using biotinylated ribonucleotides. cRNA is chemically fragmented according to protocols described by Affymetrix (Santa Clara, Calif., USA), and then hybridized overnight on Human Genome Arrays.\nAlternatively, the protein products expressed from the mRNAs may be assayed by immunohistochemistry of tumour samples, solid phase immunoassay with microtiter plates, Western blotting, 2-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, ELISA, flow cytometry and other methods known in the art for detection of specific proteins. Detection methods would include the use of site specific antibodies. The skilled person will recognize that all such well-known techniques for detection of the \u201cphiladelphia chromosome\u201d indicative of BCR-ABL translocation.\nTherefore, all of these techniques could also be used to identify tumours particularly suitable for treatment with the combinations of the invention.\nEXAMPLES\nThe invention will now be illustrated, but not limited, by reference to the specific embodiments described in the following examples.\nIn the examples, the following abbreviations may be used.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAcOH\nacetic acid\n\n\nBOC\ntert-butyloxycarbonyl\n\n\nBn\nbenzyl\n\n\nCDI\n1,1-carbonyldiimidazole\n\n\nDMAW90\nSolvent mixture: DCM: MeOH, AcOH, H2O (90:18:3:2)\n\n\nDMAW120\nSolvent mixture: DCM: MeOH, AcOH, H2O (120:18:3:2)\n\n\nDMAW240\nSolvent mixture: DCM: MeOH, AcOH, H2O (240:20:3:2)\n\n\nDCM\ndichloromethane\n\n\nDMF\ndimethylformamide\n\n\nDMSO\ndimethyl sulphoxide\n\n\nEDC\n1-ethyl-3-(3\u2032-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide\n\n\nEt3N\ntriethylamine\n\n\nEtOAc\nethyl acetate\n\n\nEt2O\ndiethyl ether\n\n\nh\nhour(s)\n\n\nHOAt\n1-hydroxyazabenzotriazole\n\n\nHOBt\n1-hydroxybenzotriazole\n\n\nMeCN\nacetonitrile\n\n\nMeOH\nmethanol\n\n\nmin.\nminutes\n\n\nP.E.\npetroleum ether\n\n\nr.t.\nroom temperature\n\n\nSiO2 \nsilica\n\n\nTBTU\nN,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethyl-O-(benzotriazol-1-yl)uronium \n\n\n \ntetrafluoroborate\n\n\nTHF\ntetrahydrofuran\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProton magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV400 instrument operating at 400.13 MHz, in DMSO-d6 or MeOH-d4 (as indicated) at 27\u00b0 C., unless otherwise stated and are reported as follows: chemical shift \u03b4/ppm (number of protons, multiplicity where s=singlet, d=doublet, t=triplet, q=quartet, m=multiplet, br=broad).

General Synthetic Methods\nIn the following general methods, the volumes stated may vary according to the scale of the reaction, as will be apparent to the skilled person.\nMethod A1\nAmide Coupling (Acid Chloride Method)\nA mixture of a carboxylic acid (1 equivalent) and thionyl chloride (1.5 equivalents) in benzene (or toluene) was stirred and held at reflux for 2 hours. Excess amine was added dropwise to the hot solution and the mixture stirred at room temperature for 15 minutes. Alternatively, the acid chloride could be isolated by evaporation and then re-dissolved in a 9:1 mixture of dichloromethane:triethylamine and the amine then added and the mixture stirred under nitrogen at room temperature for 1-18 hours. In either case, the mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate and extracted successively with water, saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate and 2M hydrochloric acid. The organic layer was reduced to dryness in vacuo and the pure products were obtained either by trituration with ethyl acetate or by column chromatography on silica (eluting with mixtures of ethyl acetate in petroleum ether) or in a few cases by preparative HPLC/MS.\nMethod A2\nAmide Coupling (EDC, HOBt Method)\nA stirred solution of the acid (1 equivalent) in dichloromethane (10 ml) was treated successively with N-ethyl-N\u2032-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (1.2 equivalents), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (1.2 equivalents) and the amine (1.5 equivalents) and the mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The mixture was washed successively with 2M hydrochloric acid and 2M sodium hydroxide, the organic layer was separated and the solvent removed in vacuo to afford the products. The products were either obtained pure or were purified by column chromatography on silica (eluting with mixtures of ethyl acetate in petroleum ether or methanol in ethyl acetate as appropriate).\nMethod A3\nAnisole or Benzyl Ether Dealkylation (BBr3 Method)\nA stirred solution of the anisole or benzyl ether (1 equivalent) in dichloromethane at 0\u00b0 C. was treated dropwise with a 1M solution of boron tribromide in dichloromethane (1.5 equivalents per group to be deprotected) and the mixture was stirred for 2 hours. The reaction was quenched by the addition of water and saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate, the organic layer was separated and the solvent was removed in vacuo. The pure products were obtained either by trituration with diethyl ether or ethyl acetate or by column chromatography on silica (eluting with mixtures of ethyl acetate in petroleum ether).\nMethod A4\nAmide Coupling (EDC, HOAt Method)\nA stirred solution of the acid (1 equivalent) in dimethylformamide (5 ml) was treated successively with N-ethyl-N\u2032-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (1.2 equivalents), 1-hydroxy-7-aza-benzotriazole (1.2 equivalents) and the amine (1.5 equivalents) and the mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. DMF was evaporated and crude dissolved in EtOAc and was washed successively with saturated sodium bicarbonate, the organic layer was separated and the solvent removed in vacuo. The products were either obtained pure or were purified by column chromatography on silica (eluting with mixtures of ethyl acetate in petroleum ether or methanol in ethyl acetate as appropriate).\nMethod A5\nHydrogenation\nA stirred solution of protected derivative (1 equivalent) and a catalytic amount of 10% palladium on carbon (typically 30-50 mg) in ethanol (5-10 ml), methanol (5-10 ml) or methanol/DCM (3 ml/3 ml) was stirred at room temperature under an atmosphere of hydrogen for 2-16 hours. The catalyst was removed by filtration, washed with methanol (5 ml) and the solvent removed in vacuo to afford the products. Some required purification by flash chromatography, eluting typically with ether.\nMethod A6\nSuzuki Coupling\nThe aryl bromide (1 equivalent, typically 0.5 mmol), boronic acid or potassium vinyl trifluoroborate derivative (1.2 equivalents) and caesium carbonate (3 equivalents) were dissolved in THF (10 ml) under nitrogen. 1,1\u2032-Bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]palladium(II) dichloride (0.1 equivalent) was added and then water (1 ml). The mixture begins to darken until black. The mixture was then heated at reflux under nitrogen until the reaction is complete (8-45 hrs). The mixture was cooled, diluted with DCM and magnesium sulphate added. The mixture was filtered and the solvent evaporated. The resulting residues were purified by flash chromatography in pet. ether/ether mixtures, and generally gave product in good yield (\u02dc60-80%).\nMethod A7\nResorcinol mono-O-methylation\nDimethyl sulphate (1 equivalent) was added to a stirred solution of the resorcinol (1 equivalent) and potassium carbonate (2.2 equivalents) in acetonitrile (10 ml per mmol of substrate) and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 hours. The solvent was removed in vacuo, the residue partitioned between dichloromethane and water, the organic layer separated and the solvent removed in vacuo. The pure products were obtained either after column chromatography on silica (eluting with mixtures of petroleum ether and ethyl acetate) or by preparative HPLC/MS.\nMethod A8\nElectrophilic Aromatic Fluorination\n1-(Chloromethyl)-4-fluoro-1,4-diazoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane bis(tetrafluoroborate) (1 equivalent) was added to a solution of the substrate (1 equivalent) in acetonitrile (15 ml per mmol of substrate) and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 hours. The solvent was removed in vacuo and the residue was partitioned between ethyl acetate and water. The organic layer was separated and reduced to dryness in vacuo. The pure products were obtained either after column chromatography on silica (eluting with mixtures of petroleum ether and ethyl acetate) or by preparative HPLC/MS.\nB. Synthesis of Carboxylic Acid Intermediates\nPreparation B1\n4-Hydroxy-3-isopropylbenzoic acid\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nCarbon tetrachloride (28 ml, 0.26 mol) and copper powder (1.0 g) were added to a stirred solution of 2-isopropylphenol (27.2 g, 0.2 mol) in 50% aqueous sodium hydroxide (120 ml) and the mixture was held at reflux for 16 hours. Upon cooling the mixture was acidified to pH 2 or below by the addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid and was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was extracted with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate and the aqueous layer acidified to pH 2 or below by the very careful addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The solution was extracted with ethyl acetate, the organic layer was washed with water, separated and the solvent removed in vacuo to afford 4-hydroxy-3-isopropylbenzoic acid (12.5 g, 35%) as a bright red solid that was used without further purification. 1H NMR (DMSO-d6) 12.36 (1H, br s), 10.13 (1H, br s), 7.73 (1H, d), 7.63 (1H, dd), 6.85 (1H, d), 3.22 (1H, m), 1.19 (6H, d). MS: [M\u2212H]+ 179.\nAlternatively, if required, the crude product may be purified using a three step procedure involving di-benzylation [according to the conditions outlined below in Preparation B5 for the synthesis of methyl 5-acetyl-2,4-bis-benzyloxybenzoate (BnBr, K2CO3, MeCN, reflux)], column chromatography on silica to remove highly coloured impurites (eluting with 3-5% ethyl acetate in petroleum ether) and catalytic hydrogenation [according to Method A5 outlined above (10% Pd/C, EtOH, H2)] to afford 4-hydroxy-3-isopropylbenzoic acid as a colourless solid.\nPreparation B2\n5-Ethyl-2-methoxybenzoic acid\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nn-Butyl lithium (2.5M in hexanes, 38.5 ml, 100.0 mmol) was added dropwise under a nitrogen atmosphere to a stirred solution of 4-ethylanisole (11.7 g, 86.0 mmol) and N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethylethylenediamine (10 ml, 88.0 mmol) in anhydrous diethyl ether (100 ml) and the mixture was stirred and held at 30\u00b0 C. for 16 hours. The mixture was cooled and poured slowly in to a mixture of excess solid carbon dioxide in anhydrous diethyl ether. Upon warming to room temperature the mixture was made basic by the addition of 2M sodium hydroxide, the aqueous layer was separated and acidified to pH 2 or below by the addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The mixture was extracted with diethyl ether, the organic layer separated and the solvent removed in vacuo to afford 5-ethyl-2-methoxybenzoic acid (5.7 g, 37%) as a pale yellow oil. 1H NMR (DMSO-d6) 12.50 (1H, br s), 7.48 (1H, d), 7.33 (1H, dd), 7.03 (1H, d), 2.56 (2H, q), 1.17 (3H, q). MS: [M+H]+ 181.\nPreparation B3\n2,4-Bis-benzyloxy-5-chloro-benzoic acid\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\n1-(2,4-Bis-benzyloxy-5-chloro-phenyl)-ethanone [prepared as per WO 2004/0500087] (1.10 g, 3.0 mmol) was added to a stirred solution of sodium hydroxide (1.20 g, 30.0 mmol) in water (10 ml) and dioxane (10 ml).

The recorded electrode potentials were converted into pH values using a calibration curve from the 4 standard buffers. Sample and control titration data were processed to produce a Bjerrum plot in the pH range 2-12. The Bjerrum plot calculation and analysis method is described in the review \u201cPhysicochemical Profiling (Solubility, Permeability and Charge State)\u201d, A. Avdeef (Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry 2001, p277-351).\nThe stoichiometry of the Compound (1) salts was deduced from the starting nH (number of protons at pH=2), (i.e. free base starts with \u22122 protons, mono-salt with \u22121 protons (Compound (1)+ acid\u2212)), while double salts (Compound (1)2+ acid2\u2212 or Compound (1)2+ 2*acid\u2212) start at nH=0.\nCompound (1) L-Lactate 1:1 Salt Crystal Forms\n(84A) Compound (1) L-Lactate\u2014Form FL1\nThe L-Lactate salt form FL1 was prepared as described in Example 2 above.\nForm FL1 is stable in air and at 40\u00b0 C. and 75% RH for at least one month.

Single crystal X-ray analysis showed that form FL2 is hydrated. It is nominally a tri-hydrate because there are 3 crystal water positions in the asymmetric unit, but they are not 100% occupied at room temperature and laboratory humidity. A saturated solution of form FL1 in methanol:water 9:1 was prepared at room temperature. Slow precipitation with approximately 4 volumes of acetone gave form FL2 which is stable in air. The XRPD pattern for form FL2 is shown in FIG. 2 and the main peaks are listed in Table 14 below.

Cloning, expression, and purification of the Human Hsp90\u03b1 N-terminal domain were performed according to published methods (Jez, J. M. et al, Chem. Biol. 2003 April; 10(4):361-8.) Solutions of the human Hsp90\u03b1 N-terminal domain and compound were prepared in a buffer comprising 25 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM TCEP, 5% DMSO, pH 7.4. All solutions were filtered and degassed prior to a titration being carried out. The enthalpy change resulting from each injection of ligand was obtained through integration of the calorimetric signal. Data were analysed using Origin 7.0 (Microcal Software Inc., Northampton, Mass.). Heats of dilution were estimated using the final injections of each individual titration and subtracted before data fitting. Different ITC experimental formats were employed in order to obtain compound dissociation constants (Kd's) over a wide range of affinities. For weakly binding compounds a low c-value ITC method was used (Turnbull W. B. & Daranas A. H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003 Dec. 3; 125(48):14859-66) in which the protein was present at 10-20 \u03bcM in the calorimetric cell and the compound concentration was 1-20 mM in the injection syringe. In this type of experiment the stoichiometry parameter (N) was locked at 1 for data fitting. For Kd's in the 20-0.004 \u03bcM range the experiment was configured such that the binding site concentration divided by the Kd (c-value) was between 5 and 1000. For the majority of these experiments the protein concentration in the calorimetric cell was in the range 4-100 \u03bcM and the ligand concentration in the injection syringe ranged from 50-1500 \u03bcM. In rare cases where compound solubility was limiting, the compound solution was placed in the calorimetric cell and titrated with protein from the injection syringe, maintaining a c-value between 5 and 1000. Competition ITC experiments were used to access Kd's <4 nM by performing the titration in the presence of a weaker binding competitor according to the method described in Sigurskjold B. W. Anal Biochem. 2000 Jan. 15; 277(2):260-6.\nThe compounds of examples 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74 and 75 were tested and were found to have Kd values of less than 1 micromolar.\nThe compounds of examples 5, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 48, 49, 50, 51, 53, 54, 55, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74 and 75 have Kd values of less than 0.1 micromolar and most of these compounds have Kd values of less than 0.01 micromolar.\nExample 86\nAnti-Proliferative Activity\nThe anti-proliferative activities of compounds for use in the combinations of the invention can be determined by measuring the ability of the compounds to inhibition of cell growth in a number of cell lines such as the human colon cancer cell line HCT116. Inhibition of cell growth is measured using the Alamar Blue assay (Nociari, M. M, Shalev, A., Benias, P., Russo, C. Journal of Immunological Methods 1998, 213, 157-167). The method is based on the ability of viable cells to reduce resazurin to its fluorescent product resorufin. For each proliferation assay cells are plated onto 96 well plates and allowed to recover for 16 hours prior to the addition of inhibitor compounds for a further 72 hours. At the end of the incubation period 10% (v/v) Alamar Blue is added and incubated for a further 6 hours prior to determination of fluorescent product at 535 nM ex/590 nM em. In the case of the non-proliferating cell assay cells are maintained at confluence for 96 hour prior to the addition of inhibitor compounds for a further 72 hours. The number of viable cells is determined by Alamar Blue assay as before. Cell lines can be obtained from the ECACC (European Collection of cell Cultures).\nThe compounds of examples 5, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 28, 29, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 74 and 75 were tested and were found to have IC50 values of less than 1 micromolar against the HCT116 cell line.\nPharmaceutical Formulations\nExample 87\n(i) Tablet Formulation\nA tablet composition containing a compound of the formula (I) is prepared by mixing 50 mg of the compound with 197 mg of lactose (BP) as diluent, and 3 mg magnesium stearate as a lubricant and compressing to form a tablet in known manner.\n(ii) Capsule Formulation\nA capsule formulation is prepared by mixing 100 mg of a compound of the formula (I) with 100 mg lactose and filling the resulting mixture into standard opaque hard gelatin capsules.\n(iii) Injectable Formulation I\nA parenteral composition for administration by injection can be prepared by dissolving a compound of the formula (I) (e.g. in a salt form) in water containing 10% propylene glycol to give a concentration of active compound of 1.5% by weight.

The vial is then sealed and sterilised by autoclaving.\n(vii) Subcutaneous Injection Formulation\nA composition for sub-cutaneous administration is prepared by mixing a compound of the formula (I) with pharmaceutical grade corn oil to give a concentration of 5 mg/ml. The composition is sterilised and filled into a suitable container.\nviii) Lyophilised Formulation\nAliquots of formulated compound of formula (I) are put into 50 ml vials and lyophilized. During lyophilisation, the compositions are frozen using a one-step freezing protocol at (\u221245\u00b0 C.). The temperature is raised to \u221210\u00b0 C. for annealing, then lowered to freezing at \u221245\u00b0 C., followed by primary drying at +25\u00b0 C. for approximately 3400 minutes, followed by a secondary drying with increased steps if temperature to 50\u00b0 C. The pressure during primary and secondary drying is set at 80 millitor.\nExample 88\nAssay for Therapeutic Efficacy\nThe effect of a compound of formula (I) (Compound I) in combination with a signalling inhibitor (Compound II) is assessed using the following technique:\nIC50 Shift Assay\nCells from human cells lines (e.g. HCT116, U87MG, A549) are seeded onto 96-well tissue culture plates at a concentration of 2.5\u00d7103, 6.0\u00d7103, or 4.0\u00d7103 cells/well respectively. Cells are allowed to recover for 48 hours prior to addition of compound(s) or vehicle control (0.35% DMSO) as follows:\nCompounds are added concurrently for 96 hours.\nFollowing a total of 96 hours compound incubation, cells are fixed with ice-cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid for 1 hour on ice and then washed four times with dH20 using a plate washer (Labsystems Wellwash Ascent) and air-dried. Cells are then stained with 0.4% (w/v) Sulforhodamine B (Sigma) in 1% acetic acid for 20 min at room temperature and then washed four times with 1% (v/v) acetic acid and air-dried before the addition of 10 mM Tris buffer to solubilise the dye. Colourmetric product is quantified by reading at Abs490 nm on a Wallac Victor2 plate reader (1420 multilabel counter, Perkin Elmer Life Sciences). The IC50 for Compound II in the presence of varying doses of Compound I is determined. Synergy is determined when the IC50 shifts down in the presence of sub-effective doses of Compound I. Additivity is determined when the response to Compound II and Compound I together results in an effect equivalent to the sum of the two compounds individually. Antagonistic effects are defined as those causing the IC50 to shift upwards, i.e. those where the response to the two compounds is less than the sum of the effect of the two compounds individually.\nExample 89\nGeneral Method for the Assessment of the Effect of Combination\nThe effect of the compound (2,4-dihydroxy-5-isopropyl-phenyl)-[5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dihydro-isoindol-2-yl]-methanone (\u201cCompound I\u201d) in combination with any signalling inhibitor (Compounds II-IV) can be assessed using the following technique:\n1. Combination Screen Assay\nHuman colon carcinoma cell line HCT 116 (ECACC No. 91091005) cells are seeded onto 96-well tissue culture plates at a concentration of 2\u00d7104 cells/ml and 200 \u03bcl per well. Cells are allowed to recover overnight prior to addition of compound(s) or vehicle control (0.2% DMSO) as follows;\nCompounds are added according to one of the following schedules;\n    a) Concurrent for 72 hours. b) Compound I for 24 hours, followed by the addition of Compound II, III or IV for a further 48 hours. c) Compound II, III or IV for 24 hours, followed by the addition of Compound I for a further 48 hours.   \nFollowing a total of 72 hours compound incubation, Alamar Blue\u2122 is added to a final concentration of 10% (v/v) and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 6 hours. Fluorescent product is quantified by reading at d535/25x (excitation) and d590/20m (emission) on a Fusion Reader (Perkin Elmer).\nThe fluorescence as a percentage of vehicle control (0.2% DMSO) is determined for cell samples treated with Compound II, III or IV, in the presence of varying concentrations of Compound I. The data are analysed using the method of multiplicity which assumes that each individual agent demonstrates a linear dose response curve. This assumption allows for the generation of a theoretical curve, termed the line of multiplicity, that represents the expected additive response.\nAdditivity is determined when the response to Compounds II, III or IV and Compound I together resulted in an effect approximately equivalent to the theoretical line of multiplicity calculated from the product of the two compounds individually. Synergy is determined when the observed response to the combined agents is greater than the theoretical line of multiplicity. Antagonism is determined when the observed response to the combined agents is less than the theoretical line of multiplicity.\nEQUIVALENTS\nThe foregoing examples are presented for the purpose of illustrating the invention and should not be construed as imposing any limitation on the scope of the invention.

        "description": "[0001]  This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/747,853, filed Jan. 23, 2013, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/293,368, filed Nov. 10, 2011, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/411,865, filed Mar. 26, 2009, which claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/040,372 filed on Mar. 28, 2010. Each of the foregoing applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.\n\n [0002]  The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing a hydrogen sulphate salt of 6-(4-bromo-2-chloro-phenylamino)-7-fluoro-3-methyl-3H-benzoimidazole-5-carboxylic acid (2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-amide (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cAgent\u201d), more particularly to orally deliverable compositions containing the Agent; to the use of said compositions as a medicament; and to processes for the preparation of said compositions.\n  [0003]  The Agent is disclosed in International Patent Application WO 2007/076245 and is a potent inhibitor of MEK. The Agent is a hydrogen sulphate salt of the compound with the structure of the Formula I:\n  [0000]  \n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\n  [0004]  The Agent possesses anti-proliferative activity and is expected to be useful in the treatment of diseases or medical conditions mediated alone or in part by MEK and particularly cancers such as brain, lung, squamous cell, bladder, gastric, pancreatic, breast, head, neck, renal, kidney, ovarian, prostate, colorectal, oesophageal, testicular, gynecological or thyroid cancer or malignant melanoma. The Agent may also be used in the treatment of a non-cancerous hyperproliferative disorder such as benign hyperplasia of the skin (e.g., psoriasis), restenosis, or prostate (e.g., benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH)) and for the treatment of other MEK mediated diseases, including pancreatitis or kidney disease (including proliferative glomerulonephritis and diabetes-induced renal disease) or the treatment of pain in a mammal. The Agent is also expected to be useful for the prevention of blastocyte implantation in a mammal, or for treating a disease related to vasculogenesis or angiogenesis in a mammal. Such diseases may include tumor angiogenesis, chronic inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, skin diseases such as psoriasis, eczema, and scleroderma, diabetes, diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, age-related macular degeneration, hemangioma, glioma, melanoma, Kaposi's sarcoma and ovarian, breast, lung, pancreatic, prostate, colon and epidermoid cancer.\n  [0005]  The free-base form of the Agent (i.e. 6-(4-bromo-2-chloro-phenylamino)-7-fluoro-3-methyl-3H-benzoimidazole-5-carboxylic acid (2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-amide) has been classified as a BCS Class 4 compound (according to the Biopharmaceutical Classification System as defined by the Guidance for Industry: Waiver of In Vivo Bioavailability and Bioequivalence studies for immediate release solid oral dosage forms based on a Biopharmaceutics Classification System) which indicates it has a low solubility/dissolution rate and low permeability. Such compounds typically exhibit low and/or variable bioavailability and indeed the bioavailability of the free base form of the Agent from a conventional tablet formulation is relatively poor (\u02dc18% in dogs).\n  [0006]  The applicants have previously identified a particular salt form of 6-(4-bromo-2-chloro-phenylamino)-7-fluoro-3-methyl-3H-benzoimidazole-5-carboxylic acid (2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-amide, which shows unique pharmaceutical properties, making it particularly suitable for use in medicaments. This particular salt form, namely the hydrogen sulphate salt (1:1 drug:H2SO4) of 6-(4-bromo-2-chloro-phenylamino)-7-fluoro-3-methyl-3H-benzoimidazole-5-carboxylic acid (2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-amide (hereinbefore and hereinafter referred to as the \u201cAgent\u201d), has been disclosed in WO 2007/076245. The salt is crystalline and has surprisingly been found to possess improved pharmaceutical properties when compared to the free-base form of the Agent and other salts of 6-(4-bromo-2-chloro-phenylamino)-7-fluoro-3-methyl-3H-benzoimidazole-5-carboxylic acid (2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-amide. In particular the dissolution rate of this salt as well as its bioavailability was found to be particularly high when compared to the free base form of the Agent and other salts of 6-(4-bromo-2-chloro-phenylamino)-7-fluoro-3-methyl-3H-benzoimidazole-5-carboxylic acid (2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-amide.\n  [0007]  In order to formulate a pharmaceutically active compound, such as the Agent, into a suitably acceptable dosage form, the active compound should, in addition to possessing acceptable biopharmaceutical properties, such as solubility and dissolution properties, also suitably possess acceptable stability and handling properties. In this respect, a particular problem occurs with the Agent. The free-base form of the Agent is a weakly basic compound and has two basic groups with pKa's of approximately 2.7 and 8.2. The pKa value expresses the strength of acids and base, i.e. the tendency for an acid to lose a proton or a base to accept a proton (Bronsted J. N. Rec. tray. Chim. (47), 718, 1923). The Agent (i.e. hydrogen sulphate salt) is particularly liable to dissociate into it's free-base form during formulation processing and/or storage. Such conversion is undesirable because the free-base form of the Agent has poorer pharmaceutical properties, particularly in terms of solubility and dissolution rate. Indeed such conversion should be avoided as it would be expected to cause a reduction in bioavailability and/or lead to an increase in inter and intra-patient variability in plasma concentrations, both of which could lead to less than optimal treatment for patients.\n  [0008]  There is, therefore, a need for pharmaceutical compositions containing the Agent (i.e. hydrogen sulphate salt), particularly compositions in which stability of the Agent is maintained during processing and storage to ensure that acceptable absorption and/or bioavailability of the Agent is achieved upon dosing.\n  [0009]  According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising the Agent and a carrier matrix, wherein the carrier matrix consists essentially of one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers selected from the following:\n  [0010]  (a) d-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate;\n  [0011]  (b) polyglycolised glycerides;\n  [0012]  (c) polyethelylene glycols (PEGs); and\n  [0013]  (d) hard fats;\n  [0000]  and wherein the Agent is dispersed within the carrier matrix.\n  [0014]  We have surprisingly found that stability of the Agent can be maintained in the compositions of the present invention. Many of the materials that are suitable for forming the carrier matrix are conventionally known in the art as, for example, emulsifiers, solubilizers and absorption enhancers and are used to improve the dissolution kinetics and bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs. However, the applicants have surprisingly found that such excipients can also be used as inert carrier matrices to stabilise the Agent in it's hydrogen sulphate form during pharmaceutical processing and long-term storage.\n  [0015]  Accordingly, the compositions of the present invention provide a means of stabilising the Agent in it's hydrogen sulphate form during formulation processing and subsequent long-term storage and as a consequence ensure that acceptable absorption and/or bioavailability of the Agent is achieved upon dosing.\n  [0016]  A further advantage of the present invention relates to the manufacturing process used to prepare suitable compositions of the invention. While most conventional formulation processes, such as those used to formulate conventional tablet dosage forms, can involve a large number of time consuming and complex steps, possibly leading to instability of the Agent, by comparison, the compositions of the present invention can be prepared by relatively simple and scalable processes.\n The Carrier Matrix\n [0017]  The carrier matrix comprises one or more of the pharmaceutically acceptable carriers defined above. The carrier matrix may comprise a single pharmaceutically acceptable carrier selected from the groups defined above, or alternatively, it may comprise a mixture. The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is selected from any one of the following groups:\n  [0018]  (a) d-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate;\n  [0019]  (b) polyglycolised glycerides;\n  [0020]  (c) polyethelylene glycols; and\n  [0021]  (d) hard fats.\n  [0022]  D-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (otherwise known as Vitamin E TPGS) is a water-soluble derivative of natural source Vitamin E and has a dual nature, similar to an amphiphile, of hydrophilicity and lipophilicty. Vitamin E TPGS is obtained by esterification of crystalline d-\u03b1-tocopheryl acid succinate by polyethylene glycol (see U.S. Pharmacopeia 25\u2014National Formulary 20). Vitamin E TPGS is already known for it's use in pharmaceutical applications as an emulsifier, solubilizer and absorption enhancer and WO 96/36316, U.S. Pat. No. 5,891,845 and WO 00/76482 may be cited as examples. See also \u201cEastman Vitamin E TPGS\u201d Eastman Brochure, Eastman Chemical Co., Kingsport, Tenn. (November 2002) for further information about the use of Vitamin E TPGS in such applications.\n  [0023]  Polyglycolysed glycerides are mixtures of glycerides of fatty acids and esters of polyoxyethylene with fatty acids. In these mixtures, the fatty acids are saturated or unsaturated and the glycerides are mono-, di- or tri-glycerides or mixtures thereof in any proportions. Examples of suitable polyglycolised glycerides include but are not limited to caprylocaproyl macrogoglycerides (for example Labrasol), oleoyl macrogolglycerides (for example Labrafil M1944 CS), linoleoyl macrogolglycerides (for example Labrafil M2125 CS), lauroyl macrogolglycerides (for example Lauroyl Macrogol-32 Glycerides) and stearoyl macrogolglycerides for example Gelucire 50/13 (see PhEur 6th Edition 2008 for further details of these polyglycolised glycerides). In a particular group of compositions, the polyglycolised glycerides contained in the carrier matrix have an hydrophilic-to-lipophillic balance value (HLB) of greater than 10. In a further particular group of compositions, the polyglycolised glycerides contained in the carrier matrix are dispersible in water. In a further particular group of compositions, the polyglycolised glycerides are lauroyl macrogolglycerides or stearoyl macrogolglycerides. In yet a further particular group of compositions, the polyglycolised glycerides are lauroyl macrogolglycerides. In yet a further particular group of compositions, the polyglycolised glyceride is Lauroyl Macrogol-32 Glycerides or Gelucire 50/13. In yet a further particular group of compositions, the polyglycolised glyceride is Lauroyl Macrogol-32 Glycerides. Lauroyl Macrogol-32 Glycerides (commercially supplied as Gelucire 44/14 or Acconon\u00ae C-44, EP) is a saturated polyglycolized glyceride consisting of mono-, di- and triglycerides and of mono- and di-fatty acids of polyethylene glycol (PEG). Lauroyl Macrogol-32 Glycerides is semi-solid/solid at room temperature, having a melting point of 44\u00b0 C. and is obtained from the reaction of hydrogenated palm kernel oil with polyethylene glycol 1500.\n  [0024]  Polyethylene glycols USP (PEG), alternatively known as macrogols (see PhEur 6th Edition 2008) are hydrophilic polymers of oxyethylene. PEGs having an average molecular weight greater than 900 daltons are generally semi-solid or solid at ambient temperature. A suitable average molecular weight range for PEGs in the present invention is 900 to 35,000 daltons. Suitable commercially available products include but are not limited to PEG 900, PEG 1000, PEG 1450, PEG 2000, PEG 6000 and PEG 20000. In a particular group of compositions, the PEG(s) present in the carrier matrix have an average molecular weight range of between 900 and 25,000 daltons. In a further particular group of formulations of this embodiment, this PEG has an average molecular weight of around 6,000 daltons. In yet a further particular group of formulations of this embodiment, the PEG has an average molecular weight of around 20,000 daltons.\n  [0025]  Hard fats are solid mixtures of monoglycerides, diglycerides and triglycerides, which are practically insoluble in water. Examples of suitable hard fats include but are not limited to Gelucire 33/01 (see USP-NF \u2018Hard fat\u2019), Gelucire 39/01 (see USP-NF and EP \u2018Hard fat\u2019) and Gelucire 43/01 (see EP 3rd edition and USP24/NF19 \u2018Hard fat\u2019).\n  [0026]  According to one embodiment of the invention, the carrier matrix consists of one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers selected from the following:\n  [0027]  (a) d-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate;\n  [0028]  (b) polyglycolised glycerides; and\n  [0029]  (c) polyethelylene glycols (PEGs);\n  [0000]  wherein the Agent is dispersed within the carrier matrix.\n  [0030]  In a further embodiment of the invention, the carrier matrix is Vitamin E TPGS.\n  [0031]  In yet a further embodiment of the invention, the carrier matrix is a polyglycolized glyceride. Conveniently, the polyglycolized glyceride is Lauroyl Macrogol-32 Glycerides or Gelucire 50/13, particularly Lauroyl Macrogol-32 Glycerides.\n  [0032]  In a further embodiment of the invention, the carrier matrix comprises a mixture of Vitamin E TPGS and at least one polyglycolised glyceride. Conveniently the at least one polyglycolised glyceride present in this embodiment is Lauroyl Macrogol-32 Glycerides and suitably the Lauroyl Macrogol-32 Glycerides is present in an amount to make up 1-60% by weight of the carrier matrix component of the composition, and conveniently approximately 30-55%, and yet more conveniently approximately 50% by weight of the carrier matrix component of the composition. Preferably, Lauroyl Macrogol-32 Glycerides is the only polyglycolized glyceride present in this embodiment.\n  [0033]  In a further embodiment of the invention, the carrier matrix comprises a mixture of Vitamin E TPGS and at least one PEG. Conveniently the at least one PEG present in this embodiment has an average molecular weight of between 900 and 25000 daltons and suitably the PEG is present in an amount to make up 1-30% by weight of the carrier matrix component of the composition, and conveniently approximately 5-15%, and yet more conveniently approximately 10% by weight of the carrier matrix component of the composition. Preferably, there is only one PEG present in this embodiment. In a particular group of formulations of this embodiment, this PEG has an average molecular weight of 6000 daltons. In yet a further particular group of formulations of this embodiment, the PEG has an average molecular weight of 20000 daltons. In yet a further particular group of formulations of this embodiment, the PEG has an average molecular weight of 1000 daltons.\n  [0034]  It is to be understood that the term \u2018approximately\u2019 as used hereinabove to refer to the proportion of excipients such as Lauroyl Macrogol-32 Glycerides or PEG in the carrier matrix component of the composition refers to \u00b12% by weight of the carrier matrix component.\n  [0035]  Suitably the composition contains from 40 to 99% by weight, particularly from approximately 60 to 95% by weight, more particularly from approximately 65 to 95% by weight of the carrier matrix.\n  [0036]  In a particular group of compositions of the present invention, the composition contains from approximately 90-95% by weight of the carrier matrix and more particularly approximately 95% by weight of the carrier matrix.\n  [0037]  In a further particular group of compositions of the present invention, the composition contains from approximately 85-90% by weight of the carrier matrix and more particularly approximately 90% by weight of the carrier matrix.\n  [0038]  In yet a further particular group of compositions of the present invention, the composition contains from approximately 75-85% by weight of the carrier matrix and more particularly approximately 80% by weight of the carrier matrix.\n  [0039]  In yet a further particular group of compositions of the present invention, the composition contains from approximately 65-80% by weight of the carrier matrix and more particularly approximately 70% by weight of the carrier matrix.\n  [0040]  It is to be understood that the term \u2018approximately\u2019 when relating to the proportion of carrier matrix in the composition refers to \u00b12% by weight of the total composition. So by way of example, if the composition is said to contain approximately 70% by weight of the carrier matrix, this would encompass compositions containing between 68-72% by weight of carrier matrix.\n  [0041]  In yet a further particular group of compositions of the present invention, the composition contains 79-81%, such as for example 79.83%, by weight of the carrier matrix.\n The Agent\n [0042]  Typically the Agent will be present in an amount within the range of from 1 to 50%, suitably from about 1 to 35% and especially from about 5 to 30% by weight of the composition. In a particular group of compositions, the Agent will be present in an amount of about 5% by weight of the final composition. In a further particular group of compositions, the Agent will be present in an amount of about 10% by weight of the final composition. In yet a further particular group of compositions, the Agent will be present in an amount of about 20% by weight of the final composition. In yet a further particular group of compositions, the Agent will be present in an amount of about 30% by weight of the final composition. In yet a further particular group of compositions, the Agent will be present in an amount of 19-21%, such as for example 20.17%, by weight of the final composition.\n  [0043]  It is to be understood that the term \u2018about\u2019 when relating to the proportion of Agent present in the composition refers to \u00b12% by weight of the total composition.\n  [0044]  Suitably a unit dose of the composition according to the invention may contain from 0.01 mg to 500 mg of Agent. Suitably each therapeutic dose of the composition will contain a sufficient quantity of the Agent to provide a daily dose of the Agent in one or more units. Suitable quantities of the Agent in unit doses in different embodiments include, for example approximately 6.05, 12.1, 18.15, 30.25, 60.5, 72.6, 78.65, 84.7, 90.75, 96.8, 102.85, 108.9, 114.95, 121, 151.25, 181.5, 242, 302.5, 363, 423.5, 484 mg or higher depending upon the dose required and the particular form of the pharmaceutical composition. In a particular embodiment a unit dose of the composition contains from 1 mg to 150 mg of Agent and particularly from 50 mg to 130 mg of Agent, such as for example approximately 72.6, 78.65, 84.7, 90.75, 96.8, 102.85, 108.9, 114.95 or 121 mg of the Agent, and especially 72.6, 78.65, 84.7, 90.75 or 96.8 mg of the Agent. The term \u2018approximately\u2019 as used directly hereinabove is defined as +/\u22122 mg of the weight quantity specified. In a particular embodiment a unit dose of the composition contains 90.75 or 60.5 mg of the Agent. In a particular embodiment a unit dose of the composition contains 90.75 mg of the Agent. In a particular embodiment a unit dose of the composition contains 60.5 mg of the Agent.\n  [0045]  The Agent may be used in various forms, all of which are included within the scope of the invention. These include amorphous or crystalline forms, and anhydrous forms as well as solvates or hydrates. In a particular group of formulations, the Agent is crystalline and is in the anhydrous form.\n  [0046]  We have found that the Agent can be stabilised in a suitable carrier matrix of the present invention. As used herein, the term \u201cstabilised\u201d means that the active ingredient (6-(4-bromo-2-chloro-phenylamino)-7-fluoro-3-methyl-3H-benzoimidazole-5-carboxylic acid (2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-amide) present in the composition following processing and/or storage is substantially present as the hydrogen sulphate salt, i.e. as the Agent as opposed to the free base form of the Agent. The skilled person would readily appreciate that an indication of the amount of the free base form of the Agent and the amount of the Agent (i.e. hydrogen sulphate form) in a composition can be obtained using techniques such as for example XRPD and 19F Solid State NMR Spectroscopy and can also be monitored by dissolution testing.\n  [0047]  As used herein, the term \u201cdispersed\u201d describes a two-phase system where one phase consists of the Agent distributed in a second phase which comprises a carrier matrix, the Agent being the dispersed phase and the carrier matrix comprising phase being the continuous phase. In a particular group of formulations, the Agent forming the \u201cdispersed phase\u201d is in the form of finely divided particles that are distributed throughout the \u201csecond phase\u201d comprising the carrier matrix. In a particular group of formulations, greater than 60% by weight of the total amount of the Agent present in the composition is dispersed. In yet a particular group of formulations, greater than 90% and preferably greater than 95% by weight of the total amount of the Agent present in the composition is dispersed. The skilled person would appreciate that an indication of the proportion of drug present in the form of a solid dispersion can be ascertained by the use of techniques such as differential Scanning calorimetry (DSC), Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA), Differential Scanning Microcalorimetry and 19F Solid State NMR Spectroscopy. The skilled person would also appreciate that the crystallinity of the drug in the formulation can be determined using techniques such as, for example, by X-ray diffraction.\n  [0048]  In a particular group of compositions of the present invention, the particle size of the dispersed Agent may vary from about 1 to 20 micron. Preferably the dispersed Agent has a particle size distribution such that 90% of the particles have a diameter of less than 15 microns.\n  [0049]  In one embodiment of the invention, the Agent is dispersed within the carrier matrix and no additional solvents or additives are present. Compositions of this embodiment can be prepared with a particularly high loading of the Agent and this is advantageous because additional components often introduce drawbacks, such as a potentially increased toxicity risk and an increased size of the dosage form, both of which can contribute to poor patient compliance and acceptability of the treatment.\n  [0050]  According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising:\n  [0051]  (i) the Agent; and\n  [0052]  (ii) a carrier matrix;\n  [0000]  wherein the carrier matrix has any of the meanings defined hereinbefore;\n\nand wherein the Agent is dispersed within the carrier matrix and the composition is semi-solid or solid at ambient temperature.\n\n  [0053]  As used herein, the term \u201csemi-solid\u201d describes a component or composition, which has a rigidity and viscosity intermediate between a solid and a liquid. A semi-solid does not flow as a powder and is not liquid at ambient temperature (i.e. it has a melting point above ambient temperature). As used herein, the term \u201csolidify\u201d means to form a solid or semi-solid. Ambient temperature is to be understood as meaning a temperature in the range of 18 to 23\u00b0 C.\n  [0054]  According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising:\n  [0055]  (i) the Agent;

Accordingly, one skilled in the art would appreciate that in certain embodiments of the invention, the Agent present in a composition of the invention could be dispersed in a mixture made up of the carrier matrix and additional excipients, such as is described in some of the particular Examples that follow hereinafter. Additional excipients, which may be present include for example preservatives, stabilisers, emulsifiers, anti-oxidants, sweeteners, flavouring agents, pH adjusting agents, dispersion aids (for example surfactants, such as for example ethoxylated castor oil (Cremophor EL), ethoxylated hydrogenated castor oil (Cremophor RH40) or polysorbate 80) and viscosity modifiers. Such additional excipients are well known to those skilled in the art and are described in, for example the Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 4th Edition, American Pharmaceutical Association; The Theory and Practice of Industrial Pharmacy, 3rd Edition, Lachman et al. 1986; Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets Volume 1, 2nd Edition, Lieberman, Hebert A., et al, 1989; Modern Pharmaceutics, Banker, Gilbert and Rhodes, Christopher T, 3rd edition, 1995; and Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 20th Edition, 2000.\n  [0085]  Suitably the composition according to the present invention is in a form adapted for oral administration, for example a capsule formulation or a liquid dispersion suitable for oral administration. Suitable capsule formulations are well known and include for example solid, liquid or semi-solid compositions contained within soft or hard gelatin capsules; water-soluble cellulose ether (for example hypromellose) or starch capsules.\n  [0086]  Accordingly, a further aspect of the invention is a pharmaceutical composition adapted for oral administration comprising the Agent and a carrier matrix, wherein the carrier matrix has any of the meanings defined hereinbefore; and wherein the Agent is dispersed within the carrier matrix.\n  [0087]  A yet further aspect of the invention is a pharmaceutical capsule composition comprising the Agent and a carrier matrix, wherein the carrier matrix has any of the meanings defined hereinbefore; and wherein the Agent is dispersed within the carrier matrix.\n  [0088]  The compositions according to the present invention may be prepared using conventional methods well known in the pharmaceutical art. For example in one particular embodiment, the component(s) of the carrier matrix are heated until molten and the Agent, which may have been size reduced for example by milling or micronization, is gradually incorporated to the molten mixture with constant agitation/stirring to ensure homogenous distribution. The molten mixture can then be filled into hard or soft capsules and allowed to cool and form a viscous liquid, solid or semi-solid mass within the capsule. The body and cap of the capsule can be sealed by conventional methods known in the art, such as for example banding.\n  [0089]  Alternatively, compositions of the invention may be prepared by other conventional methods such as for example, melt extrusion or melt granulation (see A. Royce, J, Drug Dev. Ind. Pharm. 22 (1996) 917-924, G. Verreck, Bull. tech. Gattefoss\u00e9 (2004) 85-95 and J. Breitenbach, Eur. J. Pharm. Biopharm. 54 (2002) 107-117 for details of suitable manufacturing methods).\n  [0090]  The Agent possesses anti-proliferative activity and accordingly the compositions according to the present invention are useful in the treatment of conditions such as those described in International Patent Application WO 2007/076245, which discloses the Agent (i.e. hydrogen sulphate salt) and also in WO 03/077914, in which the free base form of the Agent is exemplified. For example, the composition of the invention is useful for the treatment of many common human cancers such as malignant melanoma, brain, lung, squamous cell, bladder, gastric, pancreatic, breast, head, neck, renal, kidney, ovarian, prostate, colorectal, esophageal, testicular, gynecological or thyroid cancer. It is further expected that the compositions of the invention will be useful for the treatment of other diseases involving excessive cellular proliferation such as benign skin hyperplasia, for example psoriasis, restenosis or benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). Other examples of MEK mediated diseases, which may also be treated using the Agent include pancreatitis or kidney disease (including proliferative glomerulonephritis and diabetes-induced renal disease) or the treatment of pain in a mammal. Furthermore, the Agent may also be used for the prevention of blastocyte implantation in a mammal, or for treating a disease related to vasculogenesis or angiogenesis in a mammal. Such diseases may include tumor angiogenesis, chronic inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, skin diseases such as psoriasis, excema, and scleroderma, diabetes, diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, age-related macular degeneration, hemangioma, glioma, melanoma, Kaposi's sarcoma and ovarian, breast, lung, pancreatic, prostate, colon and epidermoid cancer.\n  [0091]  A further aspect of the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention as hereinbefore defined for use as a medicament.\n  [0092]  The Agent present in the compositions of the invention possesses anti-proliferative properties such as anti-cancer properties, which are believed to arise from its MEK inhibitory activity. Accordingly the composition of the invention is expected to be useful in the treatment of diseases or medical conditions mediated alone or in part by MEK, i.e. the composition of the invention may be used to produce a MEK inhibitory effect in a warm-blooded animal in need of such treatment. Thus the composition of the invention provides a method for treating the proliferation of malignant cells characterised by inhibition of MEK, i.e. the composition of the invention may be used to produce an anti-proliferative effect mediated alone or in part by the inhibition of MEK. Accordingly the composition of the invention is expected to be useful in the treatment of cancer by providing an anti-proliferative effect, particularly in the treatment of MEK sensitive cancers such as the cancers hereinbefore described.\n  [0093]  In an embodiment of the invention there is provided, a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention as hereinbefore defined for use in producing an anti-proliferative effect in a warm-blooded animal (preferably a human). In another embodiment there is provided a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention as hereinbefore defined for use in the treatment of a cancer. In a still further embodiment there is provided a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention for use in the prevention or treatment of tumours, which are sensitive to the inhibition of MEK.\n  [0094]  A further aspect of the present invention provides the use of a composition according to the invention as hereinbefore defined in the manufacture of a medicament for use in producing an anti-proliferative effect in a warm-blooded animal (preferably a human).\n  [0095]  A further aspect of the present invention provides the use of a composition according to the invention as hereinbefore defined in the manufacture of a medicament for use in the treatment of a cancer.\n  [0096]  A further aspect of the present invention provides a method for preventing an unacceptable reduction in bioavailability of the Agent in a patient in need of the Agent comprising orally administering to said patient a pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention as hereinbefore defined.\n  [0097]  A further aspect of the present invention provides the use of a pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention as hereinbefore defined in the manufacture of a medicament for preventing an unacceptable reduction in bioavailability of the Agent.\n  [0098]  Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be administered alone as a sole therapy or can be administered in addition with one or more other substances and/or treatments. Such conjoint treatment may be achieved by way of the simultaneous, sequential or separate administration of the individual components of the treatment. In the field of medical oncology it is normal practice to use a combination of different forms of treatment to treat each patient with cancer. In medical oncology the other component(s) of such conjoint treatment in addition to compositions of the present invention may be: surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Such chemotherapy may cover categories of therapeutic agent such as:\n  [0099]  (i) other antiangiogenic agents such as those which inhibit the effects of vascular endothelial growth factor, (for example the anti-vascular endothelial cell growth factor antibody bevacizumab [Avastin\u2122], and those that work by different mechanisms from those defined hereinbefore (for example linomide, inhibitors of integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 function, angiostatin, razoxin, thalidomide, MMP-2 (matrix-metalloprotienase 2) inhibitors, MMP-9 (matrix-metalloprotienase 9) inhibitors, and COX-II (cyclooxygenase II) inhibitors), and including vascular targeting agents (for example combretastatin phosphate and compounds disclosed in International Patent Applications WO 00/40529, WO 00/41669, WO 01/92224, WO 02/04434 and WO 02/08213 and the vascular damaging agents described in International Patent Application Publication No. WO 99/02166 the entire disclosure of which document is incorporated herein by reference, (for example N-acetylcolchinol-O-phosphate));\n  [0100]  (ii) cytostatic agents such as antioestrogens (for example tamoxifen, toremifene, raloxifene, droloxifene, iodoxyfene), oestrogen receptor down regulators (for example fulvestrant), progestogens (for example megestrol acetate), aromatase inhibitors (for example anastrozole, letrazole, vorazole, exemestane), antiprogestogens, antiandrogens (for example flutamide, nilutamide, bicalutamide, cyproterone acetate), LHRH agonists and antagonists (for example goserelin acetate, luprolide, buserelin), inhibitors of 5\u03b1-reductase (for example finasteride), anti-invasion agents (for example metalloproteinase inhibitors like marimastat and inhibitors of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor function) and inhibitors of growth factor function, (such growth factors include for example platelet derived growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor), such inhibitors include growth factor antibodies, growth factor receptor antibodies, (for example the anti-erbb2 antibody trastuzumab [Herceptin\u2122] and the anti-erbb1 antibody cetuximab [C225]), farnesyl transferase inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors for example inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor family (for example EGFR family tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as N-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-7-methoxy-6-(3-morpholinopropoxy)quinazolin-4-amine (gefitinib), N-(3-ethynylphenyl)-6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)quinazolin-4-amine (erlotinib, OSI-774) and 6-acrylamido-N-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-7-(3-morpholinopropoxy)quinazolin-4-amine (CI 1033)) and serine/threonine kinase inhibitors);

Examples of useful matrix metalloprotienase inhibitors are described in WO 96/33172 (published Oct. 24, 1996), WO 96/27583 (published Mar. 7, 1996), European Patent Publication EP 0818442A2 (published Jan. 14, 1998), European Patent EP 1004578 B1 (issued Feb. 25, 2004), WO 98/07697 (published Feb. 26, 1998), WO 98/03516 (published Jan. 29, 1998), WO 98/34918 (published Aug. 13, 1998), WO 98/34915 (published Aug. 13, 1998), WO 98/33768 (published Aug. 6, 1998), WO 98/30566 (published Jul. 16, 1998), European Patent Publication 606,046 (published Jul. 13, 1994), European Patent Publication 931,788 (published Jul. 28, 1999), WO 90/05719 (published May 31, 1990), WO 99/52910 (published Oct. 21, 1999), WO 99/52889 (published Oct. 21, 1999), WO 99/29667 (published Jun. 17, 1999), PCT International Application No. WO 99/07675 (published Feb. 18, 1999), European Patent EP0952148 B1 (issued May 12, 2004), Great Britain Patent Application No. 9912961.1 (filed Jun. 3, 1999), U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/148,464 (filed Aug. 12, 1999), U.S. Pat. No. 5,863,949 (issued Jan. 26, 1999), U.S. Pat. No. 5,861,510 (issued Jan. 19, 1999), and European Patent Publication 780,386 (published Jun. 25, 1997), all of which are incorporated herein in their entireties by reference. Preferred MMP-2 and MMP-9 inhibitors are those that have little or no activity inhibiting MMP-1. More preferred, are those that selectively inhibit MMP-2 and/or MMP-9 relative to the other matrix-metalloproteinases (i.e., MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-4, MMP-5, MMP-6, MMP-7, MMP-8, MMP-10, MMP-11, MMP-12, and MMP-13).\n  [0114]  Some specific examples of MMP inhibitors useful in the present invention are AG-3340, RO 32-3555, and RS 13-0830.\n  [0115]  The dose of Agent required in the composition of the invention for the therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of a particular disease or medical condition (for example a proliferative disease) will necessarily be varied depending on for example, the host treated and the severity of the illness being treated. The amount of the active compound administered will be dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of the disorder or condition, the rate of administration, the disposition of the compound and the discretion of the prescribing physician. However, an effective dosage is in the range of about 0.01 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day, preferably about 1 to about 35 mg/kg/day, in single or divided doses. For a 70 kg human, this would amount to about 0.7 to 7000 mg/day, preferably about 70 to about 2500 mg/day. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect, provided that such larger doses are first divided into several small doses for administration throughout the day. A unit dose of the composition will usually contain, for example 1-500 mg of active ingredient, and preferably 5-150 mg of active ingredient. Preferably a daily dose in the range of 0.03-6 mg/kg is envisaged. The invention is illustrated below by the following non-limiting examples, wherein unless stated otherwise, the \u201cAgent\u201d is a hydrogen sulphate salt of 6-(4-bromo-2-chloro-phenylamino)-7-fluoro-3-methyl-3H-benzoimidazole-5-carboxylic acid (2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-amide.\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES\n [0116]   FIG. 1 shows X-ray powder diffraction data for compositions containing varying amounts of the free-base form of the Agent and the Agent (i.e. hydrogen sulphate salt), where the x-axis shows 2-Theta values and the y-axis shows Lin (Counts). The data provides an indication of the level of detection of free-base form of the Agent in a composition using X-ray powder diffraction.\n  [0117]   FIG. 2 shows X-ray powder diffraction patterns for compositions of the present invention following manufacture, where the x-axis shows 2-Theta values and the y-axis shows Lin (Counts). The data demonstrates that only the Agent (i.e. hydrogen sulphate form) is detectable in the compositions.\n  [0118]   FIG. 3 shows 19F SS-NMR spectra used to determine the approximate limit of detection of free-base form of the Agent in a Vitamin E TPGS composition using 19F SS-NMR.\n  [0119]   FIG. 4 shows 19F SS-NMR spectra of the composition of Example 1.2. The spectra demonstrates the absence of a detectable level of free-base form of the Agent in the composition.\n  [0120]   FIG. 5 shows 19F SS-NMR spectra of the composition of Example 1.3. The spectra demonstrates the absence of a detectable level of free-base form of the Agent in the composition.\n \nEXAMPLE 1\nPreparation of Compositions of the Present Invention\n [0121]  The compositions shown in Table 1 were prepared by heating the carrier matrix to a temperature of between 60 to 70\u00b0 C. with the aid of an oven. The temperature was held for approximately 2 hours to ensure that all the material is fully molten. The Agent was then gradually added and mechanically stirred into the carrier matrix using a magnetic stir bar or high-shear homogeniser. The system was maintained at a sufficiently high temperature to keep the mixture in a molten state during the stirring, which was continued until a visibly homogenous mixture was obtained. Stirring times varied depending on the particular composition but generally were in the range of 3 to 35 minutes. The resultant mixture was then filled into HPMC capsules and allowed to cool to ambient temperature. Capsules were sealed and generally stored under refrigerated conditions until use.\n  [0000]  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nTABLE 1\n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \nAgent\nCarrier Matrix\n\n\n \nExample\n(mg per capsule)\n(mg per capsule)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n1.1\n12.10 mg\nVitamin E TPGS\n\n\n \n \n \n107.90 mg\n\n\n \n1.2\n30.25 mg\nVitamin E TPGS\n\n\n \n \n \n119.75 mg\n\n\n \n1.3\n\u20026.05 mg\nVitamin E TPGS\n\n\n \n \n \n113.95 mg\n\n\n \n1.4\n60.36 mg\nVitamin E TPGS (71.06 mg)\n\n\n \n \n \nGelucire 44/14 (71.49 mg)\n\n\n \n1.5\n30.25 mg\nVitamin E TPGS (107.78 mg)\n\n\n \n \n \nPEG 20000 (11.98 mg)\n\n\n \n1.6\n30.25 mg\nVitamin E TPGS (107.78 mg)\n\n\n \n \n \nPEG 6000 (11.98 mg)\n\n\n \n1.7\n30.25 mg\nGelucire 44/14\n\n\n \n \n \n119.75 mg\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n EXAMPLE 2\nStability of Compositions of the Present Invention by X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD)\n [0122]  An indication of the stability of the Agent (i.e. hydrogen sulphate salt) in a formulation can be provided by XRPD. This technique is capable of simultaneously detecting the crystalline free-base form of the Agent and the crystalline hydrogen sulphate salt form of the Agent within the composition. Samples of the compositions were mounted on silicon wafer mounts and analysed using the Siemen's D5000 X-ray diffractometer. The samples were exposed for 4 seconds per 0.02\u00b0 0 over the range 2\u00b0 to 40\u00b0 20 in continuous scan, theta-theta mode.\n  [0123]  The approximate limit of detection of the crystalline free-base form of the Agent within a composition of the invention was determined by preparing formulations with varying relative amounts of the crystalline free-base form of the Agent to the crystalline Agent (i.e. hydrogen sulphate salt-form) and these compositions were analysed by XRPD. FIG. 1 shows that the free-base form of the Agent was detectable to a level of 2.5% w/w free-base in a Vitamin E TPGS based composition which also nominally contained 21.2% w/w of the Agent.\n  [0124]  XRPD patterns were obtained for each of the compositions described in Examples 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 immediately after their manufacture. These patterns (shown in FIG. 2) demonstrate only the presence of the Agent (i.e. hydrogen sulphate form).\n EXAMPLE 3\nStability of Compositions of the Present Invention by Solid State NMR Spectroscopy\n [0125]  An indication of the stability of the Agent in compositions of the invention can be provided by using 19F Solid State NMR Spectroscopy (19F SS-NMR). This technique is capable of detecting both the crystalline free-base form of the Agent and the crystalline Agent (i.e. hydrogen sulphate salt form) within the composition. The free-base form of the Agent and the Agent (i.e. hydrogen sulphate salt) give distinct and characteristic fluorine peaks in the spectrum. These peaks can be integrated in the normal manner for NMR signals and the ratio of the peaks is proportional to the ratio of the two solid state forms present, i.e. the free-base form of the Agent and the Agent (i.e. hydrogen sulphate form). Analysis of compositions was carried out by placing sample material in a 4 mm MAS (Magic Angle Spinning) rotor. 19F NMR [376 MHZ] spectra with 1H composite pulse decoupling [TPPM15] was recorded on the Avance 400 spectrometer using the 4 mm HFX (Broker Biospin) probe. All samples were spun at 12 kHz using the pulse program \u201caringdec\u201d (anti-ring with decoupling). It should be noted that the frictional forces associated with the technique of magic angle spinning could result in sample heating, up to approximately 10\u00b0 C.-20\u00b0 C. above ambient temperature.\n  [0126]  The approximate limit of detection of the crystalline free-base form of the Agent within a composition of the invention was determined by preparing formulations with varying relative amounts of the crystalline free-base form of the Agent and the crystalline Agent (i.e. hydrogen sulphate salt-form). These formulations were then analysed by 19F SS-NMR. The NMR spectra depicted in FIG. 3 show that the free-base form of the Agent was detectable to a level of 1% w/w free-base in a Vitamin E TPGS based composition that also contained 28.9% w/w of the Agent (i.e. hydrogen sulphate salt).\n  [0127]  Formulations described in Examples 1.2 and 1.3 were tested by 19F SS-NMR post manufacture and no evidence of the presence of free-base form of the Agent was found, see FIG. 4 and FIG. 5. Some sample heating was observed with the analysis of these samples, which may have led to the appearance of an isotropic peak at \u2212129.5 ppm. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the peak may be attributed to the presence of 6-(4-bromo-2-chloro-phenylamino)-7-fluoro-3-methyl-3H-benzoimidazole-5-carboxylic acid (2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-amide dissolved in Vitamin E TPGS, which has become molten upon sample heating.\n EXAMPLE 4\nStability of Compositions on Storage\n [0128]  Stability studies on the compositions described in Examples 1.2 and 1.3 for up to 12 months have shown that they are stable at elevated temperatures and high humidities whilst being enclosed in white high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles (induction sealed and containing desiccant). No significant changes in the stability data for the compositions of Example 1.2 and 1.3 were observed after 12 months storage in the HDPE bottles at 25\u00b0 C./60% Relative Humidity (RH) and 30\u00b0 C./65% RH, see data in Table 1 and Table 2.\n  [0000]  \n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nComposition from Example 1.3 stored in induction\n\n\nsealed HDPE bottles containing desiccant at 25\u00b0\n\n\nC./60% RH and 30\u00b0 C./65% RH\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n12 months\n12 months\n\n\nTest\nInitial\n25\u00b0 C./60% RH\n30\u00b0 C./65% RH\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nDescription\nPlain, white,\nNo change\nNo change\n\n\n \nbanded capsules\n\n\nDrug Contenta \n4.9\n4.8\n4.8\n\n\nTotal organic\n\u2003\u20030.64 (4)\n\u2003\u20030.68 (4)\n\u2003\u20030.67 (5)\n\n\nimpuritiesb by\n\n\nHPLC (% area)\n\n\nDissolution\nComplies\nComplies\nComplies\n\n\n \nwith USP\nwith USP\nwith USP\n\n\nMean at 45\n107\u2003\u2002\u2009\n96\u2003\u2009\n99\u2003\u2009\n\n\nminutes (%)\n\n\nRSD at 45\n3.6\n4.0\n2.4\n\n\nminutes (%)\n\n\nWater content\n1.2\n0.4\n0.4\n\n\n(% w/w)\n\n\nPolymorphic\nNo free-base\nNo free-base\nNo free-base\n\n\nidentity\nform of the\nform of the\nform of the\n\n\nby XRPD\nAgent detected\nAgent detected\nAgent detected\n\n\n \n\n\n aExpressed as mg Free Base equivalent.

Dissolution in duplicate or triplicate was carried out on the formulations listed below in Table 3.\n  [0130]  Dissolution of capsules is performed according to the general procedure of the United States Pharmacopoeia Apparatus II (paddle). Samples of the dissolution medium are withdrawn at various time points after capsule addition and the 6-(4-bromo-2-chloro-phenylamino)-7-fluoro-3-methyl-3H-benzoimidazole-5-carboxylic acid (2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-amide concentration is quantified by comparison of its HPLC response peak area to that of a standard solution prepared at a level equivalent to 100% release of the compound. The method uses clear glass peak vessel dissolution pots, and Spiral Stainless Steel Capsule Sinkers are used to hold the capsules. 900m1 pH2.0 735 mOsmol\\L phosphate buffer solution is used at 27\u00b0 C. and a paddle speed of 100 rpm is used.\n  [0000]  \n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDissolution results\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nDissolution at\n \nDissolution at\n\n\nFormulation of\n50 minutes (%)\nFormulation of\n50 minutes (%)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nExample 1.1\n100\nComparator 1\n73\n\n\n \n \n(2% w/w Free Base,\n(45 min)\n\n\n \n \n21.9% w/w Agent\n\n\n \n \n(i.e. hydrogen\n\n\n \n \nsulphate salt))\n\n\nExample 1.2\n99\nComparator 2\n56\n\n\n \n \n(5% w/w Free Base,\n(40 min)\n\n\n \n \n18.2% w/w Agent\n\n\n \n \n(i.e. hydrogen\n\n\n \n \nsulphate salt))\n\n\nExample 1.3\n99\nComparator 3\n41\n\n\n(batch 1)\n \n(20% w/w Free Base)\n\n\nExample 1.3\n95\n\n\n(batch 2)\n\n\nExample 1.5\n96\n\n\nExample 1.6\n101\n\n\nExample 1.7\n95\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  [0131]  In addition to the compositions described in Examples 1.1-1.3 and 1.5-1.7, some further comparator formulations were manufactured using mixtures of crystalline free-base and crystalline Agent (i.e. hydrogen sulphate salt). The mixture of the two forms were dispersed in Vitamin E TPGS according to analogous methods to those described in Example 1 and filled into HPMC capsules.\n  [0132]  The dissolution data for the comparator formulations show that dissolution decreased as the amount of free base form of the Agent in the composition increased. A 17% drop in dissolution at 50 minutes is observed for a formulation containing 2% w/w Free Base form of the Agent. The data generated by analysing the free-base containing comparator formulations show that the dissolution method gives an indication of the level of free-base form of the Agent present within the compositions. The dissolution results for the compositions described in Examples 1.1-1.3 and 1.5-1.7 show that 95% or greater dissolution is achieved indicating that the compound is substantially present in it's hydrogen sulphate salt-form (i.e. as the Agent).\n EXAMPLE 6\nPreparation of Further Compositions of the Present Invention\n [0133]  The compositions shown in Table 4 were prepared by heating the carrier matrix in an oven set at 70\u00b0 C. for at least one hour. The Agent was then gradually added and mechanically stirred into the carrier matrix using a magnetic stir bar or a high-shear homogeniser. The system was maintained at sufficiently high temperature to keep the mixture in a molten state during stirring. Stirring was performed until a visibly homogenous mixture was obtained. The time taken for this to be achieved varied depending on the composition but was at least 10 minutes and could have been up to 60 minutes. The systems ranged in total weight from 3.75g to 75g (as indicated in Table 4). The resultant mixture was filled into HPMC capsules and allowed to cool to ambient temperature and solidify. Capsules were stored at either room temperature or under refrigerated conditions until use.\n  [0000]  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n \n\n\n \nAgent\n \nTotal weight\n\n\n \n(mg per\nCarrier Matrix\nof batch\n\n\nExample\ncapsule)\n(mg per capsule)\nprepared (g)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n6.1\n30.25 mg\nVitamin E TPGS (89.75 mg)\n3.75\n\n\n \n \nTween 80 (30.00 mg)\n\n\n6.2\n30.25 mg\nVitamin E TPGS (89.75 mg)\n3.75\n\n\n \n \nCremophor EL (30.00 mg)\n\n\n6.3\n30.25 mg\nVitamin E TPGS (89.75 mg)\n3.75\n\n\n \n \nPluronic F-68 (30.00 mg)\n\n\n6.4\n30.25 mg\nVitamin E TPGS (89.75 mg)\n3.75\n\n\n \n \nPEG 1000 (30.00 mg)\n\n\n6.5\n30.25 mg\nVitamin E TPGS (97.25 mg)\n3.75\n\n\n \n \nPEG 1000 (22.50 mg)\n\n\n6.6\n30.25 mg\nVitamin E TPGS (104.75 mg)\n3.75\n\n\n \n \nPEG 1000 (15.00 mg)\n\n\n6.7\n30.25 mg\nVitamin E TPGS (112.25 mg)\n3.75\n\n\n \n \nPEG 1000 (7.50 mg)\n\n\n6.8\n30.25 mg\nVitamin E TPGS (119.75 mg)\n3.75\n\n\n \n(API batch 1)\n\n\n6.9\n30.25 mg\nVitamin E TPGS (119.75 mg)\n3.75\n\n\n \n(API batch 2)\n\n\n6.10\n30.25 mg\nVitamin E TPGS (119.75 mg)\n3.75\n\n\n \n(API batch 3)\n\n\n6.11\n30.25 mg\nVitamin E TPGS (269.75 mg)\n7.5\n\n\n6.12\n30.25 mg\nVitamin E TPGS (119.75 mg)\n75\n\n\n6.13\n15.12 mg\nVitamin E TPGS (134.88 mg)\n75\n\n\n6.14\n\u200260.5 mg\nVitamin E TPGS (239.5 mg)\n15\n\n\n6.15\n90.75 mg\nVitamin E TPGS (359.25 mg)\n15\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n EXAMPLE 7\nDissolution of Compositions in pH 6.5 Dissolution Media\n [0134]  An in-vitro dissolution method employing pH 6.5 dissolution media was used to test the performance of compositions contained within HPMC capsules. The pH 6.5 dissolution method provided improved discrimination of the presence of free base form of the Agent in compositions when compared with the dissolution method described in Example 5. Dissolution in duplicate or triplicate was carried out on the formulations listed in Table 4 and also on the formulation of Example 1.7.\n  [0135]  Dissolution of capsules was performed according to the general procedure of the United States Pharmacopoeia Apparatus II (paddle). Samples of the dissolution medium are withdrawn at various time points after capsule addition and the 6-(4-bromo-2-chloro-phenylamino)-7-fluoro-3-methyl-3H-benzoimidazole-5-carboxylic acid (2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-amide concentration is quantified by comparison of its HPLC response peak area to that of a standard solution prepared at a level equivalent to 100% release of the compound. The method uses clear glass peak vessel dissolution pots, and Spiral Stainless Steel Capsule Sinkers are used to hold the capsules. 1000 ml of pH 6.5 dissolution media is used at 37\u00b0 C. and a paddle speed of 50 rpm is used.\n  [0136]  The pH 6.5 dissolution media is prepared by the addition of 1.74 g sodium hydroxide pellets, 19.77 g sodium dihydrogenphosphate hydrous (or 17.19 g sodium dihydrogenphosphate anhydrous) and 30.93 g sodium chloride to 5 litres of deionised water. The pH is then adjusted to 6.5 with 1M hydrochloric acid or 1M sodium hydroxide.\n  [0137]  In addition to the compositions described in Table 4, some further comparator formulations were manufactured using mixtures of crystalline free-base of the Agent and crystalline Agent (i.e. hydrogen sulphate salt-form). The mixture of the two forms were dispersed in Vitamin E TPGS according to analogous methods to those described in Example 6 and filled into HPMC capsules.

A 90% drop in dissolution at 60 minutes is observed for a formulation containing 0.4% w/w free base form of the Agent. Furthermore, the presence of 0.02% w/w free base of the Agent caused a 13% drop in dissolution at 60 minutes.

        "description": "AMORPHOUS AND CRYSTALLINE FORMS OF IDELALISIB AND PROCESS FOR FORMING THE \n SAME \nThe present invention concerns amorphous idelalisib, crystalline solvates of idelalisib and a process for the preparation of amorphous idelalisib using the crystalline solvates of idelalisib. Background of the Invention \nAn important property of a medicament for oral use is the bioavailability of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Bioavailability refers to the extent and rate at which the active moiety (drug or metabolite) enters systemic circulation, thereby accessing the site of action. One important factor influencing the bioavailability of a medicament is the solubility of an API, in particular in those cases where the API has a low solubility and a high permeability. \nIt is known that different solid forms, e.g. different polymorphs, of an active pharmaceutical ingredient can have a different solubility. When such different polymorphic forms of an API are administered to the patient they might result in different in-vivo profiles. Further, different polymorphic forms might convert into each other during production of the dosage form or during storage. As a result, dosage forms containing more than one polymorphic forms of the API might have the drawback of showing unpredictable in-vivo profiles. Furthermore, an at least partial change of the degree of structural order of a pressure- sensitive solid form of the active pharmaceutical ingredient during the production of a compressed solid dosage form can also have negative implications for the relevant properties of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, such as compactability or compatibility with other excipients, thus impeding the process for the preparation of the compressed solid dosage form. In summary, there are various reasons why the use of pure solid forms of an API in pharmaceutical compositions is generally preferred over the use of solid form mixtures. \nIdelalisib is a compound of the general formula (1 ) \n\n\n\n     \nand has the l U PAC name (S)-2-(1 -(9H-purin-6-ylamino) propyl)-5-fluoro-3- phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-one and is alternatively referred to as 5-fluoro-3-phenyl-2-[(1 S)- 1 -(9H-purin-6-ylamino)propyl]quinazolin-4(3H)-one in the label approved on 07/23/2014 for ZYDELIG, FDA NDA no. 205858. \nIdelalisib is a drug used for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The substance acts as a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor. Specifically, it blocks P1 10\u03b4, the delta isoform of PI3K. \nWO 2005/1 13554 A2 is directed to the synthesis of idelalisib and to compounds structurally related to idelalisib. In the last step of the synthesis of idelalisib, the crude product is purified by column chromatography, dissolved in ethanol and concentrated in vacuo to obtain a mixed ethanol/water solvate of idelalisib. \nWO 2013/134288 A1 describes seven polymorphic forms of idelalisib. Forms I and I I are crystalline and anhydrous. Forms I I I to VI I are solvates of /so-propyl alcohol (I PA), dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), dichloromethane (DCM) and ethanol, respectively. Forms I I I and VI I contain varying amounts of water. Additionally, it is known that Form I easily converts at least partially to Form I I under pressure conditions which are typical for tablet preparation. \nIdelalisib is commercially available under the trade name Zydelig\u00ae. However, Zydelig\u00ae tablets contain a mixture of both Forms I and I I of idelalisib. \nThe solubility of Forms I and I I of idelalisib is very low. At pH 6.8 a solubility of about 70 mg/L was measured. \nIt is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a solid form of idelalisib having an improved solubility compared to the polymorphic Form I and Form II described in WO 2013/134288. It is a further object of the invention to provide a solid \n\n form of idelalisib that allows the preparation of a pharmaceutical dosage form which is bioequivalent to the pharmaceutical composition approved with the US NDA no. 205858. It is a further object of the invention to provide a solid form of idelalisib that allows the preparation of a pharmaceutical dosage form wherein the solid state of the idelalisib is uniform. It is a further object of the invention to provide a solid form of idelalisib which is stable under compression and storage conditions. It is a further object of the invention to provide a solid form of idelalisib that allows the preparation of a pharmaceutical dosage having predictable and reproducible dissolution properties. It is a further object of the invention to provide a solid form of idelalisib that enables the provision of dosage forms having predictable and reproducible pharmacokinetic properties in patients. \nIt is further an object of the present invention to provide a process for the preparation of such a solid form of idelalisib. \nSummary of the Invention \nAccording to the present invention, the above problem is unexpectedly overcome by amorphous idelalisib, especially by pure amorphous idelalisib. In particular it has been surprisingly found that pure and stable amorphous idelalisib can be produced using novel (crystalline) solvates of idelalisib as intermediates. Specifically, it has been unexpectedly found that ferf-butanol, tetrahydrofuran (THF) and /V,/V-dimethylformamide (DMF) solvates of idelalisib are useful for the preparation of pure amorphous idelalisib on an industrial scale. \nAmorphous idelalisib produced using these novel solvates according to the present invention is essentially free from any crystalline forms of idelalisib, such as for example idelalisib crystalline Form I . Further, amorphous idelalisib according to the present invention is stable under tableting conditions as well as under high temperature/high humidity conditions and has improved solubility compared to crystalline forms of idelalisib known in the prior art. Further, it has been surprisingly found that amorphous idelalisib prepared from these new solvates is essentially free from chemical impurities. Preparing an amorphous compound essentially free from chemical impurities is often a challenging task. Yet further, the amorphous idelalisib according to the present invention has a very low content of residual solvents. Preparing an amorphous compound having a very low content of residual solvents is often a challenging task. \n\n Thus, in a first aspect, the present invention relates to amorphous idelalisib having no noticeable peak in an X-ray powder diffractogram, when measured at a temperature of 25\u00b0C with Cu K-alpha radiation. \nIn a further aspect, the present invention is directed to a process for the preparation of amorphous idelalisib comprising the steps of: \n(i) providing an idelalisib solvate, \n(ii) dissolving the idelalisib solvate of step (i) in a solvent, and \n(iii) removing the solvent. \nIn a further aspect, the present invention is directed to a process for the preparation of amorphous idelalisib comprising the steps of: \n(i) providing an idelalisib ferf-butanol solvate, and \n(ii) drying the idelalisib tert-butanol solvate provided in (i). \nIn a further aspect, the invention relates to crystalline idelalisib solvates selected from \nA) ferf-butanol solvate characterized by data selected from one or more of the following: an X-ray powder diffraction pattern with characteristic peaks at 9.4\u00b10.2, 18.9\u00b10.2,\n22.8\u00b10.2\u00b0 2-Theta when measured at a temperature of 25\u00b0C with Cu K-alpha radiation;

an X-ray powder diffraction pattern substantially as depicted in Fig. 3; and by a combination of these data; and \nC) tetrahydrofuran solvate characterized by data selected from one or more of the following: an X-ray powder diffraction pattern with characteristic peaks at 17.5\u00b10.2,\n19.4\u00b10.2, 21 .5\u00b10.2\u00b0 2-Theta when measured at a temperature of 25\u00b0C with Cu K-alpha radiation; an X-ray powder diffraction pattern substantially as depicted in Fig. 4; and by a combination of these data. \nIn a further aspect, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of idelalisib solvates of the present invention comprising the steps of \n\n (I) providing a solution of idelalisib in the corresponding solvent, \n(I I) optionally adding seed crystals, \n(I I I) stirring the solution, or performing one or more of temperature cycling, crash cooling, evaporation, or anti-solvent addition to form a slurry, \n(IV) isolating the crystalline solvate in solid form, and \n(V) optionally drying the crystalline solvate. \nIn a further aspect, the invention concerns a process for the purification of crude idelalisib, comprising the steps of: \n(I) providing a solution of crude idelalisib in an organic solvent, \n(I I) optionally adding seed crystals, and \n(I I I) stirring the solution, or performing one or more of temperature cycling, crash cooling, evaporation, or anti-solvent addition to form a slurry, \n(IV) isolating the crystalline solvate in solid form, \n(V) dissolving the crystalline solvate of idelalisib of step (IV) in a solvent, \n(VI) removing the solvent, and \n(VI I) optionally drying the product obtained in step (VI), in order to yield amorphous, preferably pure amorphous idelalisib. \nIn a further aspect, the invention relates to the use of a crystalline solvate of idelalisib for the preparation of amorphous idelalisib of the present invention. \nIn a further aspect, the invention relates to amorphous idelalisib as described herein or to a crystalline solvate of idelalisib as described herein for use in the treatment of cancer. \nIn a further aspect, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising amorphous idelalisib as described herein or a crystalline solvate of idelalisib as described herein, and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. \n\n Brief Description of the Drawings \nFig. 1 shows an X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern of amorphous idelalisib prepared by precipitation from ferf-butanol solvate of idelalisib. \nFig. 2 shows an X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern of amorphous idelalisib after compression at 740 MPa for 4.5 days. \nFig. 3 shows an X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern of the ferf-butanol solvate of idelalisib. \nFig. 4 shows a TG/DTA thermogram of the ferf-butanol solvate of idelalisib. \nFig. 5 shows an X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern of the tetrahydrofuran solvate of idelalisib. \nFig. 6 shows a TG/DTA thermogram of the tetrahydrofuran solvate of idelalisib. \nFig. 7 shows an X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern of the /V,/V-dimethylformamide solvate of idelalisib. \nFig. 8 shows a TG/DTA thermogram of the /V,/V-dimethylformamide solvate of idelalisib. \nDetailed Description of the Invention \nAmorphous idelalisib \nIn a first aspect, the invention is directed to amorphous idelalisib. Amorphous idelalisib in the context of the present invention means isolated amorphous idelalisib which is essentially free from any crystalline form of idelalisib, such as Form I or Form I I . Further, preferably the amorphous idelalisib according to the present invention is essentially pure. \n\\\"Essentially free\\\" in the context of the present invention means that no crystalline form, such as idelalisib crystalline Form I, can be detected by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) measurement, i.e. no peaks of a crystalline form of idelalisib can be observed in an XRPD measurement. Consequently, the amorphous idelalisib of the present invention is preferably phase pure. While a crystalline phase usually produces a distinctive XRPD pattern comprising sharp lines/peaks, amorphous materials produce a broad background signal. Hence, in an embodiment of the invention the amorphous \n\n idelalisib of the present invention preferably has a phase purity of 90% or more, more preferably of 95% or more, most preferably of 98% or more, as determined via XRPD. \nIn a further aspect, the invention is directed to amorphous form of idelalisib having no noticeable peak in a powder X-ray diffraction. \\\"No noticeable peak\\\" in the context of the present invention means that the XRPD does not contain any peak that the person skilled in the art would recognize as being characteristic of a crystalline phase. A peak characteristic of a crystalline phase is generally a sharp line. Hence, a peak characteristic of a crystalline phase is regarded as a peak having a width at half of its height from the top to its root, i.e. where the peak starts from the baseline, of less than 1 \u00b0 2-Theta. Further, a peak characteristic of a crystalline phase is regarded as a peak having a height to width ratio of 5 : 1 or more, wherein the width is measured at half of its height. Additionally, a peak characteristic of a crystalline phase cannot be confused by the person skilled in the art with a peak of the background, since a peak characteristic of a crystalline phase has an at least 5 times greater height than the height of the highest peaks of which the background line consists, preferably at least 10 times greater. \nIn a further embodiment, the amorphous idelalisib has an XRPD pattern substantially as shown in Fig. 1 . \\\"Substantially as shown in\\\" in the context of the present invention means a pattern that is not necessarily identical to those depicted herein, but falls within the limits of experimental or statistical error or deviations when considered by the person skilled in the art. In view of the XRPD pattern of amorphous idelalisib, \\\"substantially as shown in\\\" means the absence of peaks characteristic of a crystalline phase, while the background line or curve may have a different aspect. For example, the amorphous idelalisib having an XRPD pattern as shown in Fig. 2 has an XRPD pattern substantially as shown in Fig. 1 , since in Fig. 2 no noticeable peaks are present. \nAmorphous idelalisib of the present invention is preferably pure in view of impurities derived from compounds other than idelalisib. The terms \\\"pure\\\" or \\\"substantially pure\\\" in the context of the present invention refer to chemical purity of the amorphous idelalisib. Chemical purity of the amorphous idelalisib can for example be determined by H PLC analysis. The amorphous idelalisib of the present invention has a chemical purity of 95 wt.% or more, preferably of 98 wt.% or more, more preferably of 99.5 wt.% or more, based on the total weight of the amorphous idelalisib. \nIn particular, amorphous idelalisib can be prepared according to the method of the present invention without using column chromatography. As a consequence, any possible product contamination with silica can be avoided. In an embodiment of the \n\n invention, the amorphous idelalisib thus preferably has a content of silica which is less than 0.5 wt.%, preferably is less than 0.3 wt.%, more preferably is less than 0.1 wt.%, further more preferably is less than 0.03 wt.%, most preferably is less than 0.01 wt%, based on the total weight of the amorphous idelalisib, which can be determined by sulphated ash analysis according to Ph. Eur. 6.0, 2.4.14. \nIt is a further advantage that amorphous idelalisib obtained in the present invention has a decreased level of residual solvents compared to the idelalisib solid forms known in the art. \nThe amount of residual solvent present in amorphous idelalisib can be determined by gas chromatography. \nAnalysis can be performed on a gas chromatography equipment with a flame ionization detector (FI D) and with Headspace sampler. The internal standard solution (ISS) can be prepared by adding 1 -propanol to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to produce a solution of 1 mg/ml, and mixed well. A standard stock solution for a mixture of residual solvents such as methanol, ethanol, acetone, ethyl acetate, THF, pyridine and DMF can be prepared by adding standards of the above solvents in DMSO to produce a solution containing 1 mg/ml of each methanol, ethanol, ferf-butanol, acetone and ethyl acetate, 0.07 mg/ml tetrahydrofurane, 0.02 mg/ml pyridine and 0.09 mg/ml DMF. \nTo make a standard solution, 5 ml of the stock solution can be transferred to a 20 ml headspace vial. One ml ISS can be added, and diluted to 10 ml with DMSO. The vial is to be sealed after the addition. \n200 mg of Amorphous idelalisib is to be weighed accurately and can be added into a 20 ml headspace vial. One ml ISS is to be added, then diluted to 10 ml and the vial is then to be sealed. The spiked sample solution can be prepared by weighing 200 mg of amorphous idelalisib into six headspace vials and 1 ml_ ISS of is to be added to each vial. Five ml stock solution can be transferred into each vial and diluted with DMSO to 10ml. The vials are to be sealed. \nConditions: \nColumn: DB 624 \n Carrier: Nitrogen constant flow mode, 4.5 mL/min \n Oven: 40\u00b0C for 8 min \n 40 to 200\u00b0 C at 45\u00b0C/min \n\n 200\u00b0C for 3 min \n Sample loop 1 ml_ \n Temperature Oven 80\u00b0C, Loop 1 10\u00b0C transfer line 130\u00b0C \n Vial equilibrium time: 30 min \n Inlet 200\u00b0 C split ratio 3: 1 \n Detector FI D at 250\u00b0C \n Sampler: Headspace sampler \n Instrument: Gas Chromatography The organic volatile impurity (OVI) in the obtained amorphous idelalisib thus analyzed was detected to be less than 300 ppm, preferably less than 100 ppm, more preferably less than 50 ppm. Amorphous idelalisib of the invention is essentially free of THF. Residual ICH class 2 solvents are not detectable. \nThe International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) has divided common solvents in classes reflecting their toxicity (cf. for example Ph. Eur. 6.0, chapter 5.4). Additionally, the ICH makes recommendations as to what amounts of residual solvents are considered safe in pharmaceuticals. \nSolvents in Class 1 should not be employed in the manufacture of drug substances, excipients, and drug products because of their unacceptable toxicity or their deleterious environmental effect. However, if their use is unavoidable in order to produce a drug product with a significant therapeutic advance, then their levels should be restricted. Solvents in Class 1 comprise for example benzene, carbon tetrachloride, 1 ,2- dichloroethane, 1 , 1 -dichloroethene and 1 , 1 , 1 -trichloroethane. Solvents in Class 2 should be limited in pharmaceutical products because of their inherent toxicity. Permitted daily exposures (PDEs) are given to the nearest 0.1 mg/day, and concentrations are given to the nearest 10 ppm. \nSolvents in Class 3 may be regarded as less toxic and of lower risk to human health. Class 3 includes no solvent known as a human health hazard at levels normally accepted in pharmaceuticals. It is considered that amounts of these residual solvents of 50 mg per day or less (corresponding to 5,000 ppm) would be acceptable without justification. \nFinally, Class 4 solvents may also be of interest to manufacturers of excipients, drug substances, or drug products. However, no adequate toxicological data on which to \n\n base a PDE were found. ICH Class 4 solvents comprise isooctane, isopropyl ether, petroleum ether and trichloroacetic acid. \nMore details can be obtained by referring USP 37 Chapter <467> Residual Solvents. \nThus, in an embodiment, the present invention relates to amorphous idelalisib wherein at most 300 ppm of I CH Class 2 solvents are present. Preferably, at most 200 ppm, such as at most 150 ppm, such as at most 100 ppm, such as at most 90 ppm, at most 80 ppm, at most 70 ppm, at most 60 ppm, at most 50 ppm, at most 40 ppm, at most 30 ppm, at most 20 ppm and most preferably at most 10 ppm residual ICH Class 2 solvents are present. The present invention also relates to amorphous idelalisib which is substantially free of ICH Class 2 solvents, in particular essentially free from tetrahydrofuran and /V,/V-dimethylformamide. Preferably, the obtained amorphous idelalisib of the present invention has an overall organic volatile impurity content of up to 300 ppm, such as up to 100 ppm, for example 50 ppm, and being essentially free from ICH Class 2 solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran and /V,/V-dimethylformamide. It is a further advantage of the amorphous idelalisib of the present invention that it is stable at high temperatures and/or high relative humidity. \nIn an embodiment of the invention, the amorphous idelalisib does not have any noticeable peak, especially any peak characteristic of a crystalline form of idelalisib, in a powder X-ray diffraction after 120 hours storage at 120\u00b0C. Preferably, the amorphous idelalisib has an XRPD pattern substantially as shown in Fig. 1 after 120 hours storage at 120\u00b0C. \nIn a further embodiment of the invention, the amorphous idelalisib does not have any noticeable peak, especially any peak characteristic of a crystalline form of idelalisib, in a powder X-ray diffraction after 120 hours storage at 40\u00b0C/75% relative humidity. Preferably, the amorphous idelalisib has an XRPD pattern substantially as shown in Fig. 1 after 120 hours storage at 40\u00b0C/75% relative humidity. \nIn yet a further embodiment of the invention, the amorphous idelalisib does not have any noticeable peak, especially any peak characteristic of a crystalline form of idelalisib, in a powder X-ray diffraction after 120 hours storage at 25\u00b0C/98% relative humidity. Preferably, the amorphous idelalisib has an XRPD pattern substantially as shown in Fig. 1 after 120 hours storage at 25\u00b0C/98% relative humidity. \nThe pure amorphous idelalisib of the present invention may be further characterized by phase stability under tableting conditions. While the anhydrous crystalline Form I \n\n converts at least partially to a crystalline Form I I under pressure as applied during tableting, leading to a mixture of Forms I and I I, such as in the commercially available product Zydelig\u00ae, the amorphous idelalisib of the present invention does preferably not show any substantial phase conversion under compression. Thus, in one embodiment of the invention the amorphous idelalisib has an XRPD pattern substantially as shown in Fig. 2 after compression at 740 MPa for 4.5 days. More specifically, an XRPD pattern of amorphous idelalisib prior to compression is substantially as shown in Fig. 1 while an XRPD pattern of amorphous idelalisib after compression is substantially as shown in Fig. 2. The XRPD patterns illustrated in Fig. 1 and 2 are regarded as being identical within statistical error. \nPreparation of amorphous idelalisib \nThe invention further relates to a process for the formation of pure amorphous idelalisib as described above. In particular, it has been surprisingly found in the present invention that pure amorphous idelalisib can be prepared by using solvates of idelalisib, preferably by using the solvates of the present invention which are described below. After removing the solvent from the solvates of idelalisib, amorphous idelalisib with higher purity than the starting material can be obtained. Thus, it is possible with the process of the present invention to obtain 1 ) amorphous idelalisib and 2) with a purity which could not be obtained with the conventional processes described in the prior art. In particular, the process for the preparation of amorphous idelalisib comprises the steps of: \n(i) providing a solvate of idelalisib, \n(ii) dissolving the solvate of idelalisib of step (i) in a solvent, and \n(iii) removing the solvent. Step (i) is not limited to specific solvates of idelalisib. Preferably, the solvates of idelalisib are solvates selected from ferf-butanol, tetrahydrofuran, N,N- dimethylformamide, ethanol, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), isopropyl alcohol and dichloromethane. More preferably, the solvates of idelalisib are solvates selected from ferf-butanol, tetrahydrofuran and /V,/V-dimethylformamide. Most preferably, the solvates of idelalisib are the new solvates of the present invention. \n\n Preferably, step (ii) of dissolving the solvate of idelalisib of step (i) in a solvent is carried out at a temperature in the range of 20 to 50\u00b0C, more preferably in the range of 30 to 45\u00b0C. \nPreferably, the concentration of the solvate of idelalisib in the solution obtained in step (ii) is in the range of 15 to 1000 mg/mL, more preferably in the range of 50 to 750 mg/mL. Most preferably, the solution of the solvate of idelalisib obtained in step (ii) is saturated. \nFurther, removing the solvent in step (iii) is typically performed by one or more of precipitation and filtration, thermal desolvation, hot melt-extrusion, spray drying, or lyophilization. Preferably, removing the solvent in step (iii) is performed by one or more of precipitation and filtration, spray drying, or lyophilization. \nIn one embodiment of the invention, removing the solvent in step (iii) is carried out by adding the solution of step (ii) into water and filtrating the precipitate. Preferably, the solvent in step (ii) is selected from ethanol, methanol, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran and /V,/V-dimethylformamide, as well as mixtures thereof. More preferably, the solvent in step (ii) is ethanol. \nPreferably, the ratio between the volume of the solution of step (ii) and the volume of water to which the solution of step (ii) is added in order to lead to amorphous idelalisib to precipitate is in the range of 1 : 1 to 1 :40, such as 1 :2, 1 :3, 1 :4, 1 :5, 1 :6, 1 :7, 1 :8, 1 :9, 1 : 10, 1 : 15, 1 :20, 1 :30 and 1 :35. \nThe filtration of the amorphous idelalisib is not limited to specific methods known in the art. The filtration of the amorphous idelalisib may therefore be carried out for example by centrifuge filtration. \nMoreover, the product obtained in step (iii) may further optionally be dried, for example under reduced pressure, typically at room temperature, or heated up to a temperature between 25\u00b0C and 90\u00b0C. \nIn a further embodiment, removing the solvent in step (iii) is carried out by spray or freeze drying the solution of step (ii). Solvents in pure form or mixtures used for spray drying are preferably selected from Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) Class 3 solvent(s), further preferably with a low boiling point, most preferably acetone and dichloromethane. Solvents used for lyophilization are typically selected from dioxane, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), tetrahydrofuran, acetic acid, acetone, ethanol, methanol and ferf-butanol. Preferably, the solvent in step (ii) when step (iii) comprises a \n\n freeze drying (lyophilization) step is selected from dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, ethanol and methanol, as well as mixtures thereof. More preferably, the solvent in step (ii) is selected from dioxane, tetrahydrofuran and mixtures thereof. \nThe amount of the solvent is not particularly restricted, preferably a 10 to 100-fold amount with respect to the substrate. The time for lyophilization is not particularly restricted, preferably 1 to 240 hours, more preferably 2 to 120 hours. \nIn a further embodiment of the invention, the process for the preparation of amorphous idelalisib comprises the steps of: \n(i) providing idelalisib ferf-butanol solvate, and \n (ii) drying the idelalisib tert-butanol solvate provided in (i). \nIn a further embodiment the process for the preparation of amorphous idelalisib, as described in the previous paragraph, further comprises the steps of: \n(iii) slurrying the solid material obtained in (ii) in a solvent comprising water,\n(iv) separating at least a part of the solid material obtained in step (iii), and \n (v) drying the solid material obtained in step (iv). \nIn a preferred embodiment, the drying in step (ii) or (v) in two previous embodiments, is performed at a temperature in the range from 20 to 80 \u00b0C. \nThe term \\\"slurrying\\\" in the context of the present invention encompasses any kind of movement of a solid material suspended in a solvent caused by, but not limited to e.g. \nagitation, stirring, mixing, shaking, vibration, sonication, wet milling and the like. \nSolvates of Idelalisib \nAccording to a further aspect, the present invention refers to novel crystalline solvates of idelalisib. As used herein, solvate of idelalisib is preferably synonymous to crystalline solvate of idelalisib, i.e. the solvates of idelalisib of the present invention are preferably isolated in solid form.

The seed crystals are prepared by the same solvent used in step (I) of the process. In particular, the seed crystals are prepared by the same process steps as the solvates of the present invention. \nThe seed crystals are typically added in an amount of 0.1 wt% to 10 wt%, preferably in an amount of 0.5 wt% to 7.0 wt%, most preferably 1 .0 wt.% 5.0 wt%, on the basis of the total amount of the starting material, i.e. the solution obtained in step (I). \nIn step (I I I) the solution is transformed into a slurry by performing one or more of stirring the solution, or submitting the solution to one or more of temperature cycling, crash cooling, evaporation, or anti-solvent addition. \nStirring is performed at a temperature of 10\u00b0C to 100\u00b0C, preferably between 20\u00b0C and 50\u00b0C, most preferably at about room temperature, e.g. 22 to 25\u00b0C, typically for a period of time of 2 h to 21 days. \nTemperature cycling is preferably performed at atmospheric pressure, preferably at 2 to 22\u00b0C or 20 to 80\u00b0C, but also other conditions may be used depending on the type of solvate to be produced. Temperature cycling is typically performed for a period of 16 to 24 hours by subjecting the solution or slurry to temperature cycles such as between 20\u00b0C and 80\u00b0C, wherein each cycle may have a length of between 0.5 and 8 hours, preferably about 2 hours. A typical but not limiting temperature cycling protocol may be as follows: \n\n i) Heat from 20\u00b0C to 80\u00b0C (1 h) ii) Cool to 20\u00b0C (1 h). \nSteps i) and ii) are typically repeated 5 to 10 times. \nCrash cooling is typically performed by directly and rapidly cooling the solution from a temperature of between 25 and 50\u00b0C to a temperature of 2\u00b0C or below, such as a temperature between 0\u00b0C and -18\u00b0C, depending on the type of solvate, and keeping the solution at this temperature for example for 4 h to 24 h, such as for example 16 to 20 h. \nEvaporation is typically performed at reduced pressure, but may also be achieved at atmospheric pressure. The solvent used for anti-solvent addition may typically be selected from water, acetonitrile, a C1 -4 dialkylether, preferably methyltertbutylether (MTBE), or an alkane, preferably is selected from an alkane, more preferably a C5 alkane, a C6 alkane, a C7 alkane, a C8 alkane, or a mixture of two or more thereof, more preferably a C7 alkane, more preferably n-heptane. Preferably, the anti-solvent is water or n-heptane. The addition of anti-solvent may be carried out at a temperature in the range of 0 to 25\u00b0C. \nAdditional solvent may be added in step (I I I) in case of formation of thick slurries to allow easier stirring of the resulting slurry. \nIn an embodiment, step (I I I) comprises anti-solvent addition and evaporation. Specifically, the evaporation carried out after addition of anti-solvent leads to oily solutions or to clear solutions without precipitation. Optionally, the solutions may be sonicated before evaporation of the solvent. \nOptionally, isolation in step (IV) may be performed by using procedures known in the art, such as by filtration, centrifugation, or evaporation of solvent. Moreover, the isolated crystals may optionally be dried in step (V), e.g. under reduced pressure, typically at room temperature (25\u00b0C), or heated up to a temperature of between 25\u00b0C and 50\u00b0C or the crystals may directly be used in further processes, such as the preparation of amorphous idelalisib or isolated crystals may be used as seed crystals for the preparation of a solvate of idelalisib. The invention further relates to the use of idelalisib solvates for the manufacture of amorphous idelalisib which can be obtained by the process of the invention in pure \n\n amorphous form. In particular, it has surprisingly been found in the present invention that amorphous idelalisib can be prepared by using the solvates of the present invention. After dissolving the solvates of the present invention in a solvent and removing the solvent, pure amorphous idelalisib can be obtained. \nPurification of Crude Idelalisib \nIn another embodiment, the present invention refers to a combination of the process for the preparation of the solvates of idelalisib and the process for the preparation of pure amorphous idelalisib, both as described herein. As crude idelalisib may be used as the starting material for the preparation of the solvates of idelalisib of the present invention, which may contain any chemical impurities, such as residual amounts of silica, or may contain residual amounts of crystal forms of idelalisib, such as the crystal form I of idelalisib, it is possible with the combination of both processes to obtain amorphous idelalisib with a higher purity than the starting material. Thus, the combination of both processes may be used as a process for purification of idelalisib, such as crude idelalisib. Crude idelalisib may be for example the mixed ethanol/water solvate of idelalisib obtained after column chromatography described in WO 2005/1 13554 A2. \n\\\"Crude\\\" in the context of the present invention means having a chemical purity of less than 95 wt.%, based on the total weight of the idelalisib. Preferably, \\\"crude\\\" means having a phase purity of less than 90% in addition to the 95wt.% chemical impurity as described above. Phase purity of less than 90% comprises an amorphous form and a crystalline form having a phase purity of less than 90%, respectively. \nThus, in another aspect, the present invention refers to a process for the purification of crude idelalisib, comprising the steps of: \n(I) providing a solution of crude idelalisib in an organic solvent, \n(I I) optionally adding seed crystals, and \n(I I I) stirring the solution, or performing one or more of temperature cycling, crash cooling, evaporation, or anti-solvent addition to form a slurry, \n(IV) isolating the crystalline solvate in solid form, \n(V) dissolving the crystalline solvate of idelalisib of step (IV) in a solvent, \n(VI) removing the solvent, and \n(VI I) optionally drying the product obtained in step (VI), \n\n in order to yield amorphous, preferably pure amorphous idelalisib. \nAmorphous idelalisib with a higher purity, i.e. chemical and phase purity, than the crude idelalisib used as the starting material in step (I) is obtained in step (VI) or optionally in step (VI I). In particular, the amorphous idelalisib obtained by the above process is substantially free from silica or from residual amounts of crystal forms of idelalisib such as crystal Form I of idelalisib, which, however, may be present in the crude idelalisib used as the starting material in step (I) of the process. \nThe preferred embodiments of the process are the same as described above for the process for the preparation of the solvates of idelalisib of the present invention and the process for the preparation of pure amorphous idelalisib and thus also refer to the combination of both processes. \nPharmaceutical Composition \nIn a further aspect of the invention, the amorphous idelalisib of the present invention or a crystalline solvate of idelalisib as described herein is used in the treatment of cancer.

Embedding can mean in this context the incorporation of micro-particles in a matrix of polymers. Modified release formulations can also be \n\n obtained through encapsulation of dispersed micro-particles or emulsified micro- droplets via known dispersion or emulsion coating technologies. \nThe pharmaceutical composition facilitates administration of the compound to a mammal, preferably to a human. Idelalisib can be used singly or in combination with one or more therapeutic agents as components of mixtures. \nAmorphous Idelalisib allows the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions which are bioequivalent to the pharmaceutical composition approved with the US N DA no. \n205858. \nEXAMPLES \nIn the following, the present invention will further be described by the way of non- limiting examples. \nMethods of Measurement and Analyses \nX-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD) XRPD diffractograms were obtained with an X'Pert PRO diffractometer (PANalytical, Almelo, The Netherlands) equipped with a theta/theta coupled goniometer in transmission geometry, programmable XYZ stage with well plate holder, Cu K-alpha radiation source (wavelength 0.15418 nm) with a focusing mirror, a 0.5\u00b0 divergence slit, a 0.02\u00b0 soller slit collimator and a 0.5\u00b0 anti-scattering slit on the incident beam side, a 2 mm anti-scattering slit, a 0.02\u00b0 soller slit collimator, a Ni-filter and a solid state PIXcel detector on the diffracted beam side. The diffractogram was recorded at room temperature (25\u00b0C) at a tube voltage of 40 kV, tube current of 40 mA, applying a step size of 0.013\u00b0 2-Theta with 40 sec per step in the angular range of 2\u00b0 to 40\u00b0 2-Theta. A typical precision of the 2-Theta values is in the range of \u00b1 0.2\u00b0 2-Theta. Thus, a diffraction peak that appears for example at 9.4\u00b0 2-Theta can appear between 9.2 and 9.6\u00b0 2-theta on most X-ray diffractometers under standard conditions. \nThermogravimetric/Differential Thermal Analysis (TG/DTA) \nEach sample of material was placed into an aluminum pan and loaded into a simultaneous thermogravimetric/differential thermal analyzer (TGA/DSC1 with STARe software, Mettler-Toledo LLC, Columbus, USA) and held at 30\u00b0C for one minute. The sample was then heated under nitrogen (flow rate: 100 cm3/min) at a rate of 10\u00b0C/min from 30\u00b0C to 300\u00b0C during which time the change in sample weight was recorded along \n\n with any differential thermal events (DTA). The calibration standards were indium and tin. \n 1 H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR) \nNMR analysis was carried out on a 500MHz instrument (Bruker Biospin AG, Fallanden, Switzerland) in CDCI3 as internal standard. \nPreparation of Solvates of Idelalisib \nExample 1 : ferf-butanol solvate of idelalisib \nTo amorphous idelalisib (180 mg) were added 500 \u03bc\u0399_ of ferf-butanol/water 95:5 (v/v) at 23\u00b0C. The amorphous material dissolved. After 5 min of stirring, solids began to precipitate. The suspension was stirred at 23\u00b0C for 5 days, followed by centrifugation and separation of the precipitate. The solid was then dried, leading to a free flowing white powder (120 mg, 55%) being a crystalline ferf-butanol solvate of idelalisib containing water. Ratio idelalisib : ferf-butanol : water was about 1 : 0.5 : 3. \nThe peak list corresponding to the XRPD pattern of crystalline ferf-butanol solvate of idelalisib shown in Fig. 3 is given in the following table: \n\n     \n\n     \nFurther, the ferf-butanol solvate of idelalisib has a TG/DTA thermogram as illustrated in Fig. 4. \nExample 2: Tetrahydrofuran solvate of idelalisib \nAmorphous idelalisib (50 mg) was dissolved at 25\u00b0C in 200 \u03bc\u0399_ tetrahydrofuran. After a few minutes of stirring, solids began to precipitate. The suspension was stirred at 25\u00b0C for 5 days, followed by centrifugation and separation of the precipitate. The solid was then dried, leading to crystalline tetrahydrofuran solvate of idelalisib. \n\n The peak list corresponding to the XRPD pattern of crystalline tetrahydrofuran solvate of idelalisib shown in Fig. 5 is given in the following table: \n\n     \n    \n Further, the tetrahydrofuran solvate of ide alisib had a TG/DTA thermogram as illustrated in Fig. 6. \nExample 3: A ,A -dimethylformamide solvate of idelalisib Route A \nForm I idelalisib (50 mg) was added to /V,/V-dimethylformamide (DMF) at 5\u00b0C until undissolved solids remained. The suspension was stirred at 5\u00b0C for 5 days, followed by centrifugation and separation of the precipitate. The solid was then dried, leading to crystalline /V,/V-dimethylformamide solvate of idelalisib. 1 H NMR and TG/DTA evaluation showed the solvate to be a 1 : 1 DMF idelalisib solvate. \nThe peak list corresponding to the XRPD pattern of crystalline DMF solvate of idelalisib shown in Fig. 7 is given in the following table: \n\n     \n\n     \nFurther, the DMF solvate of idelalisib had a TG/DTA thermogram as illustrated in Fig. 8. \nForm I idelalisib (50 mg) was added to 100 \u03bc\u0399_ /V,/V-dimethylformamide (DMF) at 5\u00b0C. The solution was then added to n-heptane (1 ml.) as anti-solvent at 5\u00b0C. Since a solid did not precipitate, the solution was sonicated at 30% intensity using a Cole-Parmer \n\n 130W ultrasonic processor, stored at 5\u00b0C for 16 h and the solvent was then removed by evaporation, leading to crystalline DMF solvate (1 : 1 ) which had an XRPD and a TG/DTA substantially as shown in Figs. 7 and 8. \nPreparation of Amorphous Idelalisib Example 4: Amorphous Idelalisib a) By Precipitation \n33 mg of idelalisib ferf-butanol solvate of Example 1 were dissolved in 60 \u03bc\u0399_ ethanol at 40\u00b0C. The solution was centrifuged, filtered and the filtrate added to 600 \u03bc\u0399_ water, leading immediately to the precipitation of a solid. After stirring for 5 min, the solid was separated from the solvent by centrifuge filtration. Analysis by XRPD showed the solid to be pure amorphous idelalisib, with no noticeable peaks of a crystalline form being present, as illustrated in Fig. 1 . \nPure amorphous idelalisib had a solubility in water at 25\u00b0C of about 415 mg/L. b) By Lyophilization Essentially pure amorphous form of idelalisib was prepared according to the following protocol: 25 mg of TH F solvate of idelalisib (prepared according to Example 2) were dissolved in 1 .0 ml. of 1 ,4-dioxane at a temperature of from 40 to 50\u00b0C. The solution was sonicated (2 to 5 min in a VWR Ultrasonic Cleaner apparatus) to allow faster solid dissolution. The solution was filtered through a 0.2 \u03bc\u03b7\u03b7 filter into a round-bottomed flask and rotated within a Dewar flask containing a mixture of liquid nitrogen and acetone, forming a frozen film on the inside of the flask. The flask was lyophilized (plate temperature 20\u00b0C, pressure 0.08 mbar) during 18 hours, yielding essentially pure amorphous form of idelalisib. The XRPD pattern of the obtained amorphous idelalisib is shown in Fig. 1 . c) By directly drying tert-BuOH solvate \n125g of Idelalisib pure (Form I) was suspended in 625ml tert.-BuOH at room temperature. After heating up to 78\u00b0C and adding 438 ml of water a solution was formed. The inner temperature decreases to 60\u00b0C. The mixture was reheated to 78\u00b0C to form a solution. To this solution additional 875 ml of water were slowly added, so that the inner temperature never decreases under 70\u00b0C (this inner temperature is necessary to start crystallization during cooling ramp of 5 hours). After addition a slightly turbid mixture was obtained. The mixture was cooled under mixing to 5\u00b0C during 5 hours with additional seeding at 52\u00b0C. After 1 hour \n\n stirring at 5\u00b0C, the resulting suspension was filtered via a G3-Nutsch. The wet product was dried under vacuum (30 mbar) at 60\u00b0C (at least 40\u00b0C) for at least 17 hours to yield 133,3 g of amorphous Idelalisib with a high content of tert.-BuOH (approx. 13%) having good filtering properties. The dried amorphous Idelalisib was suspended in 2600 ml of water and stirred for 4 hours at room temperature. The resulting suspension was filtered via a G3-Nutsch and the wet product was dried under vacuum (30 mbar) at 60\u00b0C for at least 17 hours to yield 1 13,8 g amorphous Idelalisib with an lower amount of tert.-BuOH ( approx. <1 %). \nExample 5: Compression Stability of Pure Amorphous Idelalisib \n50 mg of pure amorphous idelalisib obtained as disclosed in Example 4b) were added to a KBr pellet die and compressed for 4.5 days at 740 MPa. The resultant solid disc was removed from the press and analysed by XRPD, showing no change in the amorphous phase, as illustrated in Fig. 2. \nExample 6: Thermal and Humidity Stability of Pure Amorphous Idelalisib a) 98% Relative Humidity 50 mg of pure amorphous idelalisib obtained as disclosed in Example 4b) were exposed to 98% relative humidity at 25\u00b0C for 5 days. XRPD analysis provided an XRPD pattern substantially as shown in Fig. 1 , showing no change of the amorphous form. b) 40\u00b0C/75% Relative Humidity \n50 mg of pure amorphous idelalisib obtained as disclosed in Example 4b) were exposed to 75% relative humidity at 40\u00b0C for 5 days. XRPD analysis provided an XRPD pattern substantially as shown in Fig. 1 , showing no change of the amorphous form. c) 120\u00b0C/50% Relative Humidity \n50 mg of pure amorphous idelalisib obtained as disclosed in Example 4b) were thermally stressed at 120\u00b0C and 50% relative humidity for 5 days in a sealed vial.

        "description": "[0001]  The present invention concerns amorphous idelalisib, crystalline solvates of idelalisib and a process for the preparation of amorphous idelalisib using the crystalline solvates of idelalisib.\n \nBackground of the Invention\n\n [0002]  An important property of a medicament for oral use is the bioavailability of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Bioavailability refers to the extent and rate at which the active moiety (drug or metabolite) enters systemic circulation, thereby accessing the site of action. One important factor influencing the bioavailability of a medicament is the solubility of an API, in particular in those cases where the API has a low solubility and a high permeability.\n  [0003]  It is known that different solid forms, e.g. different polymorphs, of an active pharmaceutical ingredient can have a different solubility. When such different polymorphic forms of an API are administered to the patient they might result in different in-vivo profiles. Further, different polymorphic forms might convert into each other during production of the dosage form or during storage. As a result, dosage forms containing more than one polymorphic forms of the API might have the drawback of showing unpredictable in-vivo profiles.\n  [0004]  Furthermore, an at least partial change of the degree of structural order of a pressure-sensitive solid form of the active pharmaceutical ingredient during the production of a compressed solid dosage form can also have negative implications for the relevant properties of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, such as compactability or compatibility with other excipients, thus impeding the process for the preparation of the compressed solid dosage form. In summary, there are various reasons why the use of pure solid forms of an API in pharmaceutical compositions is generally preferred over the use of solid form mixtures.\n  [0005]  Idelalisib is a compound of the general formula (1)\n      \nand has the IUPAC name (S)-2-(1-(9H-purin-6-ylamino) propyl)-5-fluoro-3-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-one and is alternatively referred to as 5-fluoro-3-phenyl-2-[(1S)-1-(9H-purin-6-ylamino)propyl]quinazolin-4(3H)-one in the label approved on 07/23/2014 for ZYDELIG, FDA NDA no. 205858.\n  [0006]  Idelalisib is a drug used for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The substance acts as a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor. Specifically, it blocks P110\u03b4, the delta isoform of PI3K.\n  [0007]    WO 2005/113554 A2  is directed to the synthesis of idelalisib and to compounds structurally related to idelalisib. In the last step of the synthesis of idelalisib, the crude product is purified by column chromatography, dissolved in ethanol and concentrated in vacuo to obtain a mixed ethanol/water solvate of idelalisib.\n  [0008]    WO 2013/134288 A1  describes seven polymorphic forms of idelalisib. Forms I and II are crystalline and anhydrous. Forms III to VII are solvates of iso-propyl alcohol (IPA), dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), dichloromethane (DCM) and ethanol, respectively. Forms III and VII contain varying amounts of water. Additionally, it is known that Form I easily converts at least partially to Form II under pressure conditions which are typical for tablet preparation.\n  [0009]  Idelalisib is commercially available under the trade name Zydelig\u00ae. However, Zydelig\u00ae tablets contain a mixture of both Forms I and II of idelalisib.\n  [0010]  The solubility of Forms I and II of idelalisib is very low. At pH 6.8 a solubility of about 70 mg/L was measured.\n  [0011]  It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a solid form of idelalisib having an improved solubility compared to the polymorphic Form I and Form II described in  WO 2013/134288 . It is a further object of the invention to provide a solid form of idelalisib that allows the preparation of a pharmaceutical dosage form which is bioequivalent to the pharmaceutical composition approved with the US NDA no. 205858. It is a further object of the invention to provide a solid form of idelalisib that allows the preparation of a pharmaceutical dosage form wherein the solid state of the idelalisib is uniform. It is a further object of the invention to provide a solid form of idelalisib which is stable under compression and storage conditions. It is a further object of the invention to provide a solid form of idelalisib that allows the preparation of a pharmaceutical dosage having predictable and reproducible dissolution properties. It is a further object of the invention to provide a solid form of idelalisib that enables the provision of dosage forms having predictable and reproducible pharmacokinetic properties in patients.\n  [0012]  It is further an object of the present invention to provide a process for the preparation of such a solid form of idelalisib.\n \nSummary of the Invention\n\n [0013]  According to the present invention, the above problem is unexpectedly overcome by amorphous idelalisib, especially by pure amorphous idelalisib. In particular it has been surprisingly found that pure and stable amorphous idelalisib can be produced using novel (crystalline) solvates of idelalisib as intermediates. Specifically, it has been unexpectedly found that tert-butanol, tetrahydrofuran (THF) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solvates of idelalisib are useful for the preparation of pure amorphous idelalisib on an industrial scale.\n  [0014]  Amorphous idelalisib produced using these novel solvates according to the present invention is essentially free from any crystalline forms of idelalisib, such as for example idelalisib crystalline Form I. Further, amorphous idelalisib according to the present invention is stable under tableting conditions as well as under high temperature/high humidity conditions and has improved solubility compared to crystalline forms of idelalisib known in the prior art. Further, it has been surprisingly found that amorphous idelalisib prepared from these new solvates is essentially free from chemical impurities. Preparing an amorphous compound essentially free from chemical impurities is often a challenging task. Yet further, the amorphous idelalisib according to the present invention has a very low content of residual solvents. Preparing an amorphous compound having a very low content of residual solvents is often a challenging task.\n  [0015]  Thus, in a first aspect, the present invention relates to amorphous idelalisib having no noticeable peak in an X-ray powder diffractogram, when measured at a temperature of 25\u00b0C with Cu K-alpha radiation.\n  [0016]  In a further aspect, the present invention is directed to a process for the preparation of amorphous idelalisib comprising the steps of:\n (i) providing an idelalisib solvate, (ii) dissolving the idelalisib solvate of step (i) in a solvent, and (iii) removing the solvent.  \n  [0017]  In a further aspect, the invention relates to crystalline idelalisib solvates selected from\n A) tert-butanol solvate characterized by data selected from one or more of the following: an X-ray powder diffraction pattern with characteristic peaks at 9.4\u00b10.2, 18.9\u00b10.2, 22.8\u00b10.2\u00b0 2-Theta when measured at a temperature of 25\u00b0C with Cu K-alpha radiation; an X-ray powder diffraction pattern substantially as depicted in Fig. 2; and by a combination of these data; B) N,N-dimethylformamide solvate characterized by data selected from one or more of the following: an X-ray powder diffraction pattern with characteristic peaks at 11.8\u00b10.2, 18.3\u00b10.2, 20.1\u00b10.2\u00b0 2-Theta when measured at a temperature of 25\u00b0C with Cu K-alpha radiation; an X-ray powder diffraction pattern substantially as depicted in Fig. 3; and by a combination of these data; and C) tetrahydrofuran solvate characterized by data selected from one or more of the following: an X-ray powder diffraction pattern with characteristic peaks at 17.5\u00b10.2, 19.4\u00b10.2, 21.5\u00b10.2\u00b0 2-Theta when measured at a temperature of 25\u00b0C with Cu K-alpha radiation; an X-ray powder diffraction pattern substantially as depicted in Fig. 4; and by a combination of these data.  \n  [0018]  In a further aspect, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of idelalisib solvates of the present invention comprising the steps of\n (I) providing a solution of idelalisib in the corresponding solvent, (II) optionally adding seed crystals, (III) stirring the solution, or performing one or more of temperature cycling, crash cooling, evaporation, or anti-solvent addition to form a slurry, (IV) isolating the crystalline solvate in solid form, and (V) optionally drying the crystalline solvate.  \n  [0019]  In a further aspect, the invention concerns a process for the purification of crude idelalisib, comprising the steps of:\n (I) providing a solution of crude idelalisib in an organic solvent, (II) optionally adding seed crystals, and (III) stirring the solution, or performing one or more of temperature cycling, crash cooling, evaporation, or anti-solvent addition to form a slurry, (IV) isolating the crystalline solvate in solid form, (V) dissolving the crystalline solvate of idelalisib of step (IV) in a solvent, (VI) removing the solvent, and (VII) optionally drying the product obtained in step (VI), \nin order to yield amorphous, preferably pure amorphous idelalisib.\n  [0020]  In a further aspect, the invention relates to the use of a crystalline solvate of idelalisib for the preparation of amorphous idelalisib of the present invention.\n  [0021]  In a further aspect, the invention relates to amorphous idelalisib as described herein or to a crystalline solvate of idelalisib as described herein for use in the treatment of cancer.\n  [0022]  In a further aspect, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising amorphous idelalisib as described herein or a crystalline solvate of idelalisib as described herein, and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.\n \nBrief Description of the Drawings\n\n [0023]  \n\n Fig. 1 shows an X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern of amorphous idelalisib prepared by precipitation from tert-butanol solvate of idelalisib.\n Fig. 2 shows an X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern of amorphous idelalisib after compression at 740 MPa for 4.5 days.\n Fig. 3 shows an X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern of the tert-butanol solvate of idelalisib.\n Fig. 4 shows a TG/DTA thermogram of the tert-butanol solvate of idelalisib.\n Fig. 5 shows an X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern of the tetrahydrofuran solvate of idelalisib.\n Fig. 6 shows a TG/DTA thermogram of the tetrahydrofuran solvate of idelalisib.\n Fig. 7 shows an X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern of the N,N-dimethylformamide solvate of idelalisib.\n Fig. 8 shows a TG/DTA thermogram of the N,N-dimethylformamide solvate of idelalisib.\n\n\n \nDetailed Description of the Invention\n\n\nAmorphous idelalisib\n\n [0024]  In a first aspect, the invention is directed to amorphous idelalisib. Amorphous idelalisib in the context of the present invention means isolated amorphous idelalisib which is essentially free from any crystalline form of idelalisib, such as Form I or Form II. Further, preferably the amorphous idelalisib according to the present invention is essentially pure.\n  [0025]  \\\"Essentially free\\\" in the context of the present invention means that no crystalline form, such as idelalisib crystalline Form I, can be detected by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) measurement, i.e. no peaks of a crystalline form of idelalisib can be observed in an XRPD measurement. Consequently, the amorphous idelalisib of the present invention is preferably phase pure. While a crystalline phase usually produces a distinctive XRPD pattern comprising sharp lines/peaks, amorphous materials produce a broad background signal. Hence, in an embodiment of the invention the amorphous idelalisib of the present invention preferably has a phase purity of 90% or more, more preferably of 95% or more, most preferably of 98% or more, as determined via XRPD.\n  [0026]  In a further aspect, the invention is directed to amorphous form of idelalisib having no noticeable peak in a powder X-ray diffraction. \\\"No noticeable peak\\\" in the context of the present invention means that the XRPD does not contain any peak that the person skilled in the art would recognize as being characteristic of a crystalline phase. A peak characteristic of a crystalline phase is generally a sharp line. Hence, a peak characteristic of a crystalline phase is regarded as a peak having a width at half of its height from the top to its root, i.e. where the peak starts from the baseline, of less than 1\u00b0 2-Theta. Further, a peak characteristic of a crystalline phase is regarded as a peak having a height to width ratio of 5 : 1 or more, wherein the width is measured at half of its height. Additionally, a peak characteristic of a crystalline phase cannot be confused by the person skilled in the art with a peak of the background, since a peak characteristic of a crystalline phase has an at least 5 times greater height than the height of the highest peaks of which the background line consists, preferably at least 10 times greater.\n  [0027]  In a further embodiment, the amorphous idelalisib has an XRPD pattern substantially as shown in Fig. 1. \\\"Substantially as shown in\\\" in the context of the present invention means a pattern that is not necessarily identical to those depicted herein, but falls within the limits of experimental or statistical error or deviations when considered by the person skilled in the art. In view of the XRPD pattern of amorphous idelalisib, \\\"substantially as shown in\\\" means the absence of peaks characteristic of a crystalline phase, while the background line or curve may have a different aspect. For example, the amorphous idelalisib having an XRPD pattern as shown in Fig. 2 has an XRPD pattern substantially as shown in Fig. 1, since in Fig. 2 no noticeable peaks are present.\n  [0028]  Amorphous idelalisib of the present invention is preferably pure in view of impurities derived from compounds other than idelalisib. The terms \\\"pure\\\" or \\\"substantially pure\\\" in the context of the present invention refer to chemical purity of the amorphous idelalisib. Chemical purity of the amorphous idelalisib can for example be determined by HPLC analysis. The amorphous idelalisib of the present invention has a chemical purity of 95 wt.% or more, preferably of 98 wt.% or more, more preferably of 99.5 wt.% or more, based on the total weight of the amorphous idelalisib.\n  [0029]  In particular, amorphous idelalisib can be prepared according to the method of the present invention without using column chromatography. As a consequence, any possible product contamination with silica can be avoided. In an embodiment of the invention, the amorphous idelalisib thus preferably has a content of silica which is less than 0.5 wt.%, preferably is less than 0.3 wt.%, more preferably is less than 0.1 wt.%, further more preferably is less than 0.03 wt.%, most preferably is less than 0.01 wt%, based on the total weight of the amorphous idelalisib, which can be determined by sulphated ash analysis according to Ph. Eur. 6.0, 2.4.14.\n  [0030]  It is a further advantage that amorphous idelalisib obtained in the present invention has a decreased level of residual solvents compared to the idelalisib solid forms known in the art.\n  [0031]  The types and amounts of residual solvent present in amorphous idelalisib can be determined by gas chromatography as described in detail in chapter 467 of USP 37 NF32 (The United States Pharmacopeia, as official from December 1, 2014 to April 30, 2015) by following the sequence of procedure A, procedure B and procedure C as explained in detail on pages 219 to 223, which are hereby incorporated by reference.\n  [0032]  The cumulative amounts of class 1 and class 2 solvents in the obtained amorphous idelalisib thus analyzed was detected to be less than 300 ppm, preferably less than 100 ppm, more preferably less than 50 ppm. Amorphous idelalisib of the invention is essentially free of THF. Residual ICH class 2 solvents are not detectable.\n  [0033]  The International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) has divided common solvents in classes reflecting their toxicity (cf. for example Ph. Eur. 6.0, chapter 5.4). Additionally, the ICH makes recommendations as to what amounts of residual solvents are considered safe in pharmaceuticals.\n  [0034]  Solvents in Class 1 should not be employed in the manufacture of drug substances, excipients, and drug products because of their unacceptable toxicity or their deleterious environmental effect. However, if their use is unavoidable in order to produce a drug product with a significant therapeutic advance, then their levels should be restricted. Solvents in Class 1 comprise for example benzene, carbon tetrachloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,1-dichloroethene and 1,1,1-trichloroethane.\n  [0035]  Solvents in Class 2 should be limited in pharmaceutical products because of their inherent toxicity. Permitted daily exposures (PDEs) are given to the nearest 0.1 mg/day, and concentrations are given to the nearest 10 ppm.\n  [0036]  Solvents in Class 3 may be regarded as less toxic and of lower risk to human health. Class 3 includes no solvent known as a human health hazard at levels normally accepted in pharmaceuticals. It is considered that amounts of these residual solvents of 50 mg per day or less (corresponding to 5,000 ppm) would be acceptable without justification.\n  [0037]  Finally, Class 4 solvents may also be of interest to manufacturers of excipients, drug substances, or drug products. However, no adequate toxicological data on which to base a PDE were found. ICH Class 4 solvents comprise isooctane, isopropyl ether, petroleum ether and trichloroacetic acid.\n  [0038]  More details can be obtained by referring USP 37 Chapter <467> Residual Solvents.\n  [0039]  Thus, in an embodiment, the present invention relates to amorphous idelalisib wherein at most 300 ppm of ICH Class 2 solvents are present. Preferably, at most 200 ppm, such as at most 150 ppm, such as at most 100 ppm, such as at most 90 ppm, at most 80 ppm, at most 70 ppm, at most 60 ppm, at most 50 ppm, at most 40 ppm, at most 30 ppm, at most 20 ppm and most preferably at most 10 ppm residual ICH Class 2 solvents are present. The present invention also relates to amorphous idelalisib which is substantially free of ICH Class 2 solvents, in particular essentially free from tetrahydrofuran and N,N-dimethylformamide. Preferably, the obtained amorphous idelalisib of the present invention has an overall organic volatile impurity content of up to 300 ppm, such as up to 100 ppm, for example 50 ppm, and being essentially free from ICH Class 2 solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran and N,N-dimethylformamide.\n  [0040]  It is a further advantage of the amorphous idelalisib of the present invention that it is stable at high temperatures and/or high relative humidity.\n  [0041]  In an embodiment of the invention, the amorphous idelalisib does not have any noticeable peak, especially any peak characteristic of a crystalline form of idelalisib, in a powder X-ray diffraction after 120 hours storage at 120\u00b0C. Preferably, the amorphous idelalisib has an XRPD pattern substantially as shown in Fig. 1 after 120 hours storage at 120\u00b0C.\n  [0042]  In a further embodiment of the invention, the amorphous idelalisib does not have any noticeable peak, especially any peak characteristic of a crystalline form of idelalisib, in a powder X-ray diffraction after 120 hours storage at 40\u00b0C/75% relative humidity. Preferably, the amorphous idelalisib has an XRPD pattern substantially as shown in Fig. 1 after 120 hours storage at 40\u00b0C/75% relative humidity.\n  [0043]  In yet a further embodiment of the invention, the amorphous idelalisib does not have any noticeable peak, especially any peak characteristic of a crystalline form of idelalisib, in a powder X-ray diffraction after 120 hours storage at 25\u00b0C/98% relative humidity. Preferably, the amorphous idelalisib has an XRPD pattern substantially as shown in Fig. 1 after 120 hours storage at 25\u00b0C/98% relative humidity.\n  [0044]  The pure amorphous idelalisib of the present invention may be further characterized by phase stability under tableting conditions. While the anhydrous crystalline Form I converts at least partially to a crystalline Form II under pressure as applied during tableting, leading to a mixture of Forms I and II, such as in the commercially available product Zydelig\u00ae, the amorphous idelalisib of the present invention does preferably not show any substantial phase conversion under compression.\n  [0045]  Thus, in one embodiment of the invention the amorphous idelalisib has an XRPD pattern substantially as shown in Fig. 2 after compression at 740 MPa for 4.5 days. More specifically, an XRPD pattern of amorphous idelalisib prior to compression is substantially as shown in Fig. 1 while an XRPD pattern of amorphous idelalisib after compression is substantially as shown in Fig. 2. The XRPD patterns illustrated in Fig. 1 and 2 are regarded as being identical within statistical error.\n \nPreparation of amorphous idelalisib\n\n [0046]  The invention further relates to a process for the formation of pure amorphous idelalisib as described above. In particular, it has been surprisingly found in the present invention that pure amorphous idelalisib can be prepared by using solvates of idelalisib, preferably by using the solvates of the present invention which are described below. After removing the solvent from the solvates of idelalisib, amorphous idelalisib with higher purity than the starting material can be obtained. Thus, it is possible with the process of the present invention to obtain 1) amorphous idelalisib and 2) with a purity which could not be obtained with the conventional processes described in the prior art.\n  [0047]  In particular, the process for the preparation of amorphous idelalisib comprises the steps of:\n (i) providing a solvate of idelalisib, (ii) dissolving the solvate of idelalisib of step (i) in a solvent, and (iii) removing the solvent.  \n  [0048]  Step (i) is not limited to specific solvates of idelalisib. Preferably, the solvates of idelalisib are solvates selected from tert-butanol, tetrahydrofuran, N,N-dimethylformamide, ethanol, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), isopropyl alcohol and dichloromethane. More preferably, the solvates of idelalisib are solvates selected from tert-butanol, tetrahydrofuran and N,N-dimethylformamide. Most preferably, the solvates of idelalisib are the new solvates of the present invention.\n  [0049]  Preferably, step (ii) of dissolving the solvate of idelalisib of step (i) in a solvent is carried out at a temperature in the range of 20 to 50\u00b0C, more preferably in the range of 30 to 45\u00b0C.\n  [0050]  Preferably, the concentration of the solvate of idelalisib in the solution obtained in step (ii) is in the range of 15 to 1000 mg/mL, more preferably in the range of 50 to 750 mg/mL. Most preferably, the solution of the solvate of idelalisib obtained in step (ii) is saturated.\n  [0051]  Further, removing the solvent in step (iii) is typically performed by one or more of precipitation and filtration, thermal desolvation, hot melt-extrusion, spray drying, or lyophilization. Preferably, removing the solvent in step (iii) is performed by one or more of precipitation and filtration, spray drying, or lyophilization.\n  [0052]  In one embodiment of the invention, removing the solvent in step (iii) is carried out by adding the solution of step (ii) into water and filtrating the precipitate. Preferably, the solvent in step (ii) is selected from ethanol, methanol, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran and N,N-dimethylformamide, as well as mixtures thereof. More preferably, the solvent in step (ii) is ethanol.\n  [0053]  Preferably, the ratio between the volume of the solution of step (ii) and the volume of water to which the solution of step (ii) is added in order to lead to amorphous idelalisib to precipitate is in the range of 1:1 to 1:40, such as 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, 1:6, 1:7, 1:8, 1:9, 1: 10, 1:15, 1:20, 1:30 and 1:35.\n  [0054]  The filtration of the amorphous idelalisib is not limited to specific methods known in the art. The filtration of the amorphous idelalisib may therefore be carried out for example by centrifuge filtration.\n  [0055]  Moreover, the product obtained in step (iii) may further optionally be dried, for example under reduced pressure, typically at room temperature, or heated up to a temperature between 25\u00b0C and 90\u00b0C.\n  [0056]  In a further embodiment, removing the solvent in step (iii) is carried out by spray or freeze drying the solution of step (ii). Solvents in pure form or mixtures used for spray drying are preferably selected from Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) Class 3 solvent(s), further preferably with a low boiling point, most preferably acetone and dichloromethane. Solvents used for lyophilization are typically selected from dioxane, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), tetrahydrofuran, acetic acid, acetone, ethanol, methanol and tert-butanol. Preferably, the solvent in step (ii) when step (iii) comprises a freeze drying (lyophilization) step is selected from dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, ethanol and methanol, as well as mixtures thereof. More preferably, the solvent in step (ii) is selected from dioxane, tetrahydrofuran and mixtures thereof.\n  [0057]  The amount of the solvent is not particularly restricted, preferably a 10 to 100-fold amount with respect to the substrate. The time for lyophilization is not particularly restricted, preferably 1 to 240 hours, more preferably 2 to 120 hours.\n \nSolvates of Idelalisib\n\n [0058]  According to a further aspect, the present invention refers to novel crystalline solvates of idelalisib. As used herein, solvate of idelalisib is preferably synonymous to crystalline solvate of idelalisib, i.e. the solvates of idelalisib of the present invention are preferably isolated in solid form. The novel crystalline solvates can be used as intermediates in the preparation of pure amorphous idelalisib as described herein.\n  [0059]  In an aspect, the present invention relates to a crystalline idelalisib solvate selected from a tert-butanol solvate, a tetrahydrofuran solvate and a N,N-dimethylformamide solvate.\n  [0060]  Preferably, crystalline idelalisib tert-butanol solvate of the present invention is characterized by data selected from one or more of the following:\n a) an X-ray powder diffraction pattern with characteristic peaks at 9.4\u00b10.2, 18.9\u00b10.2, 22.8\u00b10.2\u00b0 2-Theta when measured at a temperature of 25\u00b0C with Cu K-alpha radiation; b) an X-ray powder diffraction pattern substantially as depicted in Fig. 3; \nand by a combination of these data.\n  [0061]  Additionally, crystalline idelalisib tert-butanol solvate is preferably characterized by a thermogravimetric/differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) thermogram substantially similar to the one set forth in Fig. 4, when measured at a rate of 10\u00b0C/min from 30\u00b0C to 300\u00b0C.\n  [0062]  Preferably, crystalline idelalisib tetrahydrofuran solvate is characterized by data selected from one or more of the following:\n a) an X-ray powder diffraction pattern with characteristic peaks at 17.5\u00b10.2, 19.4\u00b10.2, 21.5\u00b10.2\u00b0 2-Theta when measured at a temperature of 25\u00b0C with Cu K-alpha radiation; b) an X-ray powder diffraction pattern substantially as depicted in Fig. 5; \nand by a combination of these data.\n  [0063]  Additionally, crystalline idelalisib tetrahydrofuran solvate is preferably characterized by a thermogravimetric/differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) thermogram substantially similar to the one set forth in Fig. 6, when measured at a rate of 10\u00b0C/min from 30\u00b0C to 300\u00b0C.\n  [0064]  Preferably, crystalline idelalisib N,N-dimethylformamide solvate is characterized by data selected from one or more of the following:\n a) an X-ray powder diffraction pattern with characteristic peaks at 11.8\u00b10.2, 18.3\u00b10.2, 20.1\u00b10.2\u00b0 2-Theta when measured at a temperature of 25\u00b0C with Cu K-alpha radiation; b) an X-ray powder diffraction pattern substantially as depicted in Fig. 7; \nand by a combination of these data.\n  [0065]  Additionally, crystalline idelalisib N,N-dimethylformamide solvate is preferably characterized by a thermogravimetric/differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) thermogram substantially similar to the one set forth in Fig. 8, when measured at a rate of 10\u00b0C/min from 30\u00b0C to 300\u00b0C.\n  [0066]  In particular, the crystalline solvates of idelalisib of the present invention may be characterized by the peaks listed in the following tables, showing the main 6 peaks (Table 1) and the main 10 peaks (Table 2) in an XRPD diffractogram.\n Table 1 - Peak selection (6 Peaks)                tert-butanol solvate THF solvate DMF solvate   \u00b02Theta (\u00b10.2) Rel.

The stoichiometry can be determined by DTA/TG and/or 1H NMR.\n  [0068]  In an embodiment, the idelalisib tert-butanol solvate preferably comprises tert-butanol in the range of 0.2 mol to 1.5 mol, more preferably in the range of 0.3 mol to 1.3 mol, most preferably in the range of 0.4 mol to 1.1 mol per mol idelalisib.\n  [0069]  Preferably, the idelalisib tert-butanol solvate further comprises water. The tert-butanol solvate may contain water in the range of 0.5 to 5 mol per mol idelalisib, preferably in the range of 1 to 4 mol, more preferably in the range of 1.5 to 3.5 mol water per mol idelalisib.\n  [0070]  In one embodiment, the idelalisib tert-butanol solvate comprises tert-butanol preferably in the range of 0.2 mol to 1.5 mol, more preferably in the range of 0.3 mol to 1.3 mol, most preferably in the range of 0.4 mol to 1.1 mol per mol idelalisib and water preferably in the range of 0.5 to 5 mol per mol idelalisib, more preferably in the range of 1 to 4 mol, most preferably in the range of 1.5 to 3.5 mol water per mol idelalisib.\n  [0071]  In a further embodiment, the idelalisib tetrahydrofuran solvate preferably comprises tetrahydrofuran in the range of 0.1 mol to 1.0 mol, more preferably in the range of 0.2 mol to 0.8 mol, most preferably in the range of 0.3 mol 0.7 mol per mol idelalisib.\n  [0072]  In a further embodiment, the idelalisib N,N-dimethylformamide solvate preferably comprises N,N-dimethylformamide in the range of 0.5 mol to 1.5 mol, more preferably in the range of 0.7 mol to 1.3 mol, most preferably in the range of 0.8 mol to 1.2 mol per mol idelalisib.\n  [0073]  The idelalisib tetrahydrofuran and the N,N-dimethylformamide solvates may additionally comprise water in the range of 0 mol to 0.5 mol per mol idelalisib.\n \nPreparation of the Solvates of Idelalisib\n\n [0074]  The solvates of the present invention can be prepared by a process comprising the steps of\n (I) providing a solution of idelalisib in the corresponding solvent, (II) optionally adding seed crystals, (III) stirring the solution, or performing one or more of temperature cycling, crash cooling, evaporation, or anti-solvent addition to form a slurry, (IV) isolating the crystalline solvate in solid form, and (V) optionally drying the crystalline solvate.  \n  [0075]  The organic solvent in step (I) is preferably selected from tert-butanol, tert-butanol/water, tetrahydrofuran and N,N-dimethylformamide.\n  [0076]  Preferably, tert-butanol/water is a mixture of tert-butanol and water in a ratio in the range of 80:20 to 99.5:0.5, more preferably 85:15 to 99:1, most preferably 90:10 to 98:2 (v/v).\n  [0077]  Dissolution of idelalisib in step (I) can be obtained at temperatures in the range of 4\u00b0C to 80\u00b0C depending on the solvent used, preferably in the range of 10 to 70 \u00b0C, more preferably in the range of 20 to 60\u00b0C, most preferably in the range of 30 to 50\u00b0C.\n  [0078]  A crystalline form of idelalisib, such as Form I, Form II or a mixture of Forms I and II, or amorphous idelalisib can be used as the idelalisib to be dissolved in step (I).\n  [0079]  Optionally, seed crystals may be added in step (II). The seed crystals are prepared by the same solvent used in step (I) of the process. In particular, the seed crystals are prepared by the same process steps as the solvates of the present invention.\n  [0080]  The seed crystals are typically added in an amount of 0.1 wt% to 10 wt%, preferably in an amount of 0.5 wt% to 7.0 wt%, most preferably 1.0 wt.% 5.0 wt%, on the basis of the total amount of the starting material, i.e. the solution obtained in step (I).\n  [0081]  In step (III) the solution is transformed into a slurry by performing one or more of stirring the solution, or submitting the solution to one or more of temperature cycling, crash cooling, evaporation, or anti-solvent addition.\n  [0082]  Stirring is performed at a temperature of 10\u00b0C to 100\u00b0C, preferably between 20\u00b0C and 50\u00b0C, most preferably at about room temperature, e.g. 22 to 25\u00b0C, typically for a period of time of 2 h to 21 days.\n  [0083]  Temperature cycling is preferably performed at atmospheric pressure, preferably at 2 to 22\u00b0C or 20 to 80\u00b0C, but also other conditions may be used depending on the type of solvate to be produced. Temperature cycling is typically performed for a period of 16 to 24 hours by subjecting the solution or slurry to temperature cycles such as between 20\u00b0C and 80\u00b0C, wherein each cycle may have a length of between 0.5 and 8 hours, preferably about 2 hours. A typical but not limiting temperature cycling protocol may be as follows:\n i) Heat from 20\u00b0C to 80\u00b0C (1 h) ii) Cool to 20\u00b0C (1 h).  \n  [0084]  Steps i) and ii) are typically repeated 5 to 10 times.\n  [0085]  Crash cooling is typically performed by directly and rapidly cooling the solution from a temperature of between 25 and 50\u00b0C to a temperature of 2\u00b0C or below, such as a temperature between 0\u00b0C and -18\u00b0C, depending on the type of solvate, and keeping the solution at this temperature for example for 4 h to 24 h, such as for example 16 to 20 h.\n  [0086]  Evaporation is typically performed at reduced pressure, but may also be achieved at atmospheric pressure.\n  [0087]  The solvent used for anti-solvent addition may typically be selected from water, acetonitrile, a C1-4 dialkylether, preferably methyltertbutylether (MTBE), or an alkane, preferably is selected from an alkane, more preferably a C5 alkane, a C6 alkane, a C7 alkane, a C8 alkane, or a mixture of two or more thereof, more preferably a C7 alkane, more preferably n-heptane. Preferably, the anti-solvent is water or n-heptane.\n  [0088]  The addition of anti-solvent may be carried out at a temperature in the range of 0 to 25\u00b0C.\n  [0089]  Additional solvent may be added in step (III) in case of formation of thick slurries to allow easier stirring of the resulting slurry.\n  [0090]  In an embodiment, step (III) comprises anti-solvent addition and evaporation. Specifically, the evaporation carried out after addition of anti-solvent leads to oily solutions or to clear solutions without precipitation. Optionally, the solutions may be sonicated before evaporation of the solvent.\n  [0091]  Optionally, isolation in step (IV) may be performed by using procedures known in the art, such as by filtration, centrifugation, or evaporation of solvent.\n  [0092]  Moreover, the isolated crystals may optionally be dried in step (V), e.g. under reduced pressure, typically at room temperature (25\u00b0C), or heated up to a temperature of between 25\u00b0C and 50\u00b0C or the crystals may directly be used in further processes, such as the preparation of amorphous idelalisib or isolated crystals may be used as seed crystals for the preparation of a solvate of idelalisib.\n  [0093]  The invention further relates to the use of idelalisib solvates for the manufacture of amorphous idelalisib which can be obtained by the process of the invention in pure amorphous form. In particular, it has surprisingly been found in the present invention that amorphous idelalisib can be prepared by using the solvates of the present invention. After dissolving the solvates of the present invention in a solvent and removing the solvent, pure amorphous idelalisib can be obtained.\n \nPurification of Crude Idelalisib\n\n [0094]  In another embodiment, the present invention refers to a combination of the process for the preparation of the solvates of idelalisib and the process for the preparation of pure amorphous idelalisib, both as described herein. As crude idelalisib may be used as the starting material for the preparation of the solvates of idelalisib of the present invention, which may contain any chemical impurities, such as residual amounts of silica, or may contain residual amounts of crystal forms of idelalisib, such as the crystal form I of idelalisib, it is possible with the combination of both processes to obtain amorphous idelalisib with a higher purity than the starting material. Thus, the combination of both processes may be used as a process for purification of idelalisib, such as crude idelalisib. Crude idelalisib may be for example the mixed ethanol/water solvate of idelalisib obtained after column chromatography described in  WO 2005/113554 A2 .\n  [0095]  \\\"Crude\\\" in the context of the present invention means having a chemical purity of less than 95 wt.%, based on the total weight of the idelalisib. Preferably, \\\"crude\\\" means having a phase purity of less than 90% in addition to the 95wt.% chemical impurity as described above. Phase purity of less than 90% comprises an amorphous form and a crystalline form having a phase purity of less than 90%, respectively.\n  [0096]  Thus, in another aspect, the present invention refers to a process for the purification of crude idelalisib, comprising the steps of:\n (I) providing a solution of crude idelalisib in an organic solvent, (II) optionally adding seed crystals, and (III) stirring the solution, or performing one or more of temperature cycling, crash cooling, evaporation, or anti-solvent addition to form a slurry, (IV) isolating the crystalline solvate in solid form, (V) dissolving the crystalline solvate of idelalisib of step (IV) in a solvent, (VI) removing the solvent, and (VII) optionally drying the product obtained in step (VI),  \n  [0097]  in order to yield amorphous, preferably pure amorphous idelalisib.\n  [0098]  Amorphous idelalisib with a higher purity, i.e. chemical and phase purity, than the crude idelalisib used as the starting material in step (I) is obtained in step (VI) or optionally in step (VII). In particular, the amorphous idelalisib obtained by the above process is substantially free from silica or from residual amounts of crystal forms of idelalisib such as crystal Form I of idelalisib, which, however, may be present in the crude idelalisib used as the starting material in step (I) of the process.\n  [0099]  The preferred embodiments of the process are the same as described above for the process for the preparation of the solvates of idelalisib of the present invention and the process for the preparation of pure amorphous idelalisib and thus also refer to the combination of both processes.\n Pharmaceutical Composition\n [0100]  In a further aspect of the invention, the amorphous idelalisib of the present invention or a crystalline solvate of idelalisib as described herein is used in the treatment of cancer. In particular, cancer may be hematologic malignancy, preferably a B cell malignancy, preferably selected from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, diffuse large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL), multiple myeloma (MM), marginal zone lymphoma (NHL), hairy cell leukemia, acute lymphocyte leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\n  [0101]  Consequently, the present invention also refers to a pharmaceutical composition comprising amorphous idelalisib as described herein or a crystalline solvate of idelalisib as described herein, as an active pharmaceutical ingredient.\n  [0102]  The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising amorphous idelalisib as an active pharmaceutical ingredient, and wherein at most 300 ppm of ICH Class 2 solvents are present. Preferably, at most 200 ppm, such as at most 150 ppm, such as at most 100 ppm, such as at most 90 ppm, at most 80 ppm, at most 70 ppm, at most 60 ppm, at most 50 ppm, at most 40 ppm, at most 30 ppm, at most 20 ppm and most preferably at most 10 ppm residual ICH Class 2 solvents are present in the pharmaceutical composition of the invention. The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising amorphous idelalisib which is substantially free of ICH Class 2 solvents, in particular essentially free from tetrahydrofuran and N,N-dimethylformamide.\n  [0103]  In an embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention contains as active pharmaceutical ingredient only amorphous idelalisib of the present invention.\n  [0104]  In a further embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention comprises idelalisib, wherein at least 90 wt.%, such as 95 wt.%, is amorphous idelalisib according to the present invention, based on the weight of idelalisib present in the pharmaceutical composition.\n  [0105]  Preferably, the pharmaceutical composition further comprises one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Preferably, the one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are selected from binders, fillers, lubricants, glidants, disintegrants, sweeteners, antioxidants, preservatives and colorants, more details of these excipients described in subsequent embodiments.\n  [0106]  The pharmaceutical composition is typically a solid oral dosage form. It may be administered to a subject by multiple administration routes, including but not limited to, oral (non-limiting examples for suitable dosage forms include solid dosage forms, like tablets, powders, capsules, suppositories, sachets, troches and lozenges), parenteral (( non-limiting examples. intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular), intranasal, buccal, topical, rectal, or transdermal administration routes. More details of oral solid dosage form compositions described in subsequent embodiments.\n  [0107]  In an embodiment of the invention, the pharmaceutical composition is a compressed solid oral dosage form.

        "description": "Description \n A CRYSTALLINE FORM OF POSACONAZOLE \nIt is the object of the present invention a new crystalline form of Posaconazole, referred to as Form A, having new and distinctive chemical-physical characteristics herein described, in addition to a pharmaceutical composition comprising it. It is a further object of the present invention a process for preparing said Posaconazole, Form A. Posaconazole, amorphous solid obtained from Posaconazole, Form A, is also claimed.. \nBackground of the Art \n Posaconazole (CAS Registry Number 171228-49-2), represented by the following formula (I), is known as an \n\n     \n Chemical name of Posaconazole of formula (I) is 2, 5-anhydre-l, 3, 4-trideoxy-2-C- (2, -difluorophenyl) -4- [[4-[4-[4-[l-[(lS,2S) -l-ethyl-2-hydroxypropyl] -1, 5- dihydro-5-oxo-4H-l, 2, 4-triazol-4-yl] phenyl] -1- \n\n piperazinyl] phenoxyjmethyl] -1- (lH-1, 2, 4-triazol-l-yl) -D- threo-pentitol. \n WO95/17407 and WO 96/38443 disclose a compound of formula (I) and the use thereof in the treatment of fungal infections. \n Three polymorphic forms of Posaconazole, Form I, II, and III are described and characterized in WO 99/18097. \n WO 10/000668 discloses a further crystalline form, Posaconazole, Form IV. \n A further form of Posaconazole, Form V, is discloses in WO 11/158248. . \n There is the need for alternative forms of Posaconazole, which are more stable when used in pharmaceutical compositions and/or which have advantageous properties for the preparation and storage thereof . \n The physical properties of an active ingredient in the solid state are crucial for the management of the material during its conversion into a pharmaceutical product. Particularly, the flowing properties are pointed out, in addition to the dissolution rate in an aqueous liquid. The dissolution in water is particularly critical for Posaconazole, it being a highly lipophilic base. The dissolution rate in an aqueous liquid affect the dissolution rate of the active ingredient in the \n\n stomach of a patient, with clear therapeutically consequences. Furthermore, the dissolution rate has to be taken into high account also in the formulation of syrups, elixirs, and other liquid medicaments. These and other physical characteristics are affected by the configuration and orientation of the molecules in the unit cell, which defines a particular polymorphic form of a substance. The polymorphic form may give rise to a thermal behavior that is different from that of the amorphous material or another polymorphic form. The thermal behavior is measured in a laboratory by techniques such as capillary melting point, thermo- gravimetric analysis- (TGA) , and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) , and it can be used to distinguish some polymorphic forms from other ones. A particular polymorphic form may also give rise to distinct spectroscopic properties, detectable by X-ray crystallography, NMR spectrometry, and IR spectrometry. \n The finding of new forms of Posaconazole provides a new opportunity to improve the synthesis process of the pharmaceutical active ingredient (API) , resulting in a form of Posaconazole with improved characteristics, for example, in terms of fluidity and solubility, the need of which is felt in the state of the art. \n A new crystalline form of Posaconazole is herein for the first time prepared, described, and \n\n characterized, having distinctive and advantageous chemical-physical characteristics, i.e., Posaconazole Form A. \n Description of the invention \n The object of the present invention is to provide a new crystalline form of Posaconazole. \n A more complete understanding of the present invention can be achieved with reference to the summarizing tables of some chemical-physical characteristics of Posaconazole, Form A, set forth herein below. \n The main X-ray scattering peaks, the main bands and the characteristics of the FT-IR spectrum, differential scanning thermal analysis (DSC) , thermo- gravimetric analysis, evolved gas analysis (EGA) , absorption/desorption measurements of the humidity administered by gas flow (DVS) are set forth. \n The X-ray powder diffractogram (XRPD) was obtained by using an X'Pert PRO PANalytical tool, equipped with X'Celerator detector and X-ray tube (Cu LFF PW3373/00 DK312503) with 40mA current intensity and 40kV voltage.

Furthermore, there is a continuous weight loss passing from about 400\u00b0 C to about 450\u00b0 C. The events characteristic of the measured weight loss are best noticed on the DTG curve, which is set forth on the same graph. The DTG curve represents the derivate of the thermogram and allows observing events at about 170\u00b0 C and at about 410\u00b0 C, associated to the sample degradation following a heating. \n In order to better characterize the observed events, with the thermo-gravimetric analysis, an evolved gas analysis (EGA) has been carried out, the results of which are set forth in Fig. 5. By comparing the absorbance of the gas output by the EGA analysis at the weight loss observed at about 50\u00b0 C with the water absorbance profile as available from the database, see Fig. 6, it is confirmed that the weight loss observed at about 50\u00b0 C for Posaconazole, Form A is attributable to the water loss. \n\n Finally, DVS analysis was performed. A sample of Posaconazole, Form A, was inserted in a DVS chamber at 25\u00b0 C and subject to a stepwise hydration from 40 to 90%RH. The sample, as shown by Fig. 7, shows a hydration phenomenon with about 1.75% weight change at 90% RH, 25\u00b0 C. The water is lost, decreasing, from 90 at 9% RH and only partially recovered when the systems goes back from 0 to 40%. The XRPD analysis shows that the powder is\u25a0 a mixture of the Form A (hydrated) and form I (dry) , as set forth in Fig. 8. \n Said crystalline form, claimed herein, is obtained starting from Posaconazole Form I, as described in WO9918097A1. \n It is a further object of the present invention the process for preparing said Form A of Posaconazole. Said process provides for the use of Posaconazole, Form I, as described in the state of the art referred to in the preceding description, and it comprises a precipitation mediated by the addition of an antisolvent at a temperature above the room temperature, followed by cooling and short stirring. Particularly, said process comprises: \n i) resuspending Posaconazole Form I in a suitable solvent ; \n ii) heating while stirring at a suitable temperature until achieving a clear solution; \n\n iii) adding a suitable antisolvent in a suitable ratio with said solvent; \n iv) cooling, while stirring, the solution obtained in iii) to room temperature; \n v) stirring the solution obtained in iv) at a suitable temperature and during a suitable time period; \n vi) filtering the mixture obtained in iv) so as to isolate the precipitate; \n vii) drying the precipitate at a suitable temperature. In a preferred embodiment, said step ii) occurs at a temperature of about 35-40\u00b0 C, and said solvent is acetone. In said step iii), said antisolvent is water, and the water/acetone ratio is 3/1 v/v. In said step v) , the suspension is kept under stirring for about 1 hour, preferably at room temperature. \n The product obtained is Posaconazole, Form A claimed in the present invention. \n It is a further object of the present invention the process for obtaining Posaconazole, amorphous solid, starting from said Posaconazole, Form A. \nSaid process comprises: \ni) keeping under vacuum at room temperature during at least 3 hours, or during 6 hours, or during about 18 hours Posaconazole, Form A; \n\n ii) bringing the product resulting from step i) at a temperature ranging between 35 and 50\u00b0 C, or between 37 and 45\u00b0 C, or between 38 and 43\u00b0 C, preferably at about 40\u00b0 C under vacuum, where said conditions are kept for at least 30 minutes, or for at least 60 minutes, preferably for about 90 minutes. \n The resulting product is Posaconazole, amorphous solid having the XRPD spectrum a's set forth in Fig. 20.

        "description": "The present invention relates to the preparation of chiral compounds, in particular to the preparation of chiral compounds which may be used as intermediates for the preparation of antifungal agents, preferably posaconazole.\nBACKGROUND PRIOR ART\nPosaconazole (CAS Registry Number 171228-49-2; CAS Name: 2,5-anhydro-1,3,4-trideoxy-2-C-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-4-[[4-[4-[4-[1-[(1S,2S)-1-ethyl-2-hydroxypropyl]-1,5-dihydro-5-oxo-4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl]phenyl]-1-piperazinyl]phenoxy]methyl]-1-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-D-threo-pentitol) is a triazole antifungal drug represented by the structure:\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nPosaconazole is used, for example, to prevent and/or treat invasive fungal infections caused by Candida species, Mucor species, Aspergillus species, Fusarium species, or Coccidioides species in immunocompromised patients and/or in patients where the disease is refractory to other antifungal agents such as amphothericin B, fluconazole, or itraconazole, and/or in patients who do not tolerate these antifungal agents.\nOne of the important intermediates for the preparation of posaconazole is the compound of formula (IX)\n              \nwherein both residues Y1 and Y2 are F. Therefore, there generally is a constant need for advantageous processes for the preparation of this intermediate.\n\nAccording to the known prior art processes, a common starting material for the preparation of chiral compounds according to formula (IX) is a substituted olefin compound according to the following formula (II)\n              \nwherein L is a suitable leaving group such Cl, Br, and sulfonates.\n\nHowever, said prior art processes provide only comparatively complicated processes for the preparation of these compounds of formula (II), abbreviated in the following by Ar\u2014C(\u2550CH2)\u2014CH2-L, in particular compounds wherein Y1 and Y2 are both F.\nWO 94/25452 discloses a process wherein a Ar\u2014C(\u2550CH2)\u2014CH2-L is obtained by reacting the respective allylic alcohol Ar\u2014C(\u2550CH2)\u2014CH2\u2014OH with either a brominating agent or a sulfonylating agent. In order to obtain the allylic alcohol in turn, several procedures are taught in the literature.\nOne procedure described in WO 94/25452 starts from Ar\u2014C(\u2550O)\u2014CH2-L from which, in a 3-step process, the allylic alcohol is obtained. In the first step, Ar\u2014C(\u2550O)\u2014CH2\u2014Cl is reacted with KOAc (potassium acetate) to obtain Ar\u2014C(\u2550O)\u2014CH2\u2014OAc which is then subjected to a reaction with CH3Ph3PBr (methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide) and NaHMDS (sodium hexamethyldisilazane) in the presence of THF (tetrahydrofuran) to give Ar\u2014C(\u2550CH2)\u2014CH2\u2014OAc. In the third step, Ar\u2014C(\u2550CH2)\u2014CH2\u2014OAc is further reacted with KOH (potassium hydroxide) to finally obtain Ar\u2014C(\u2550CH2)\u2014CH2\u2014OH. Apart from the fact that this procedure makes use of 3 consecutive steps, each of which has to be carried out in a separate reaction vessel, it is noted that in particular as far as the second step is concerned, the reaction product is not easy to be separated from the by-product triphenylphosphine oxide.\nAnother procedure described in P. Blundell et al., Synlett 1994, pp. 263-265, starts from Ar\u2014Br which, in a first step, is converted into a Grignard reagent which in turn is reacted with (Cl\u2014CH2)2C\u2550O (1,2-dichloro acetone) wherefrom Ar\u2014C(OH)(CH2Cl)2 is obtained which, in a second step, is treated with potassium carbonate to obtain an epoxide. This epoxide, in turn, is then converted, in a third step, to Ar\u2014C(\u2550CH2)\u2014CH2\u2014OH. Apart from the fact that this procedure for manufacturing the allylic alcohol involves 3 steps, each of which has to be carried out in a separate reaction vessel, it is known that the Grignard reagent derived from Ar\u2014Br, i.e. 2,4-difluoro bromobenzene, is a potentially hazardous compound.\nWO 95/16658 A1 suggests another procedure for the preparation of Ar\u2014C(\u2550CH2)\u2014CH2-L which starts from Ar\u2014C(\u2550O)\u2014CH3. In a Grignard reaction with consecutive elimination, the olefin compound Ar\u2014C(\u2550CH2)\u2014CH3 is obtained which is then subjected to radical halogenation to obtain Ar\u2014C(\u2550CH2)\u2014CH2-L (with L=Cl, Br). Compared to the two procedures discussed above, this procedure provides a process which, although involving 3 steps, can be carried out in only 2 reaction vessels, due to the fact that the Grignard reaction and the subsequent elimination are carried out in a single vessel. A major drawback of this procedure, however, has to be seen in the fact that the radical halogenation gives an undesired mixture of allyl halides and vinyl halides.\nTherefore, it was an object of the present invention to provide an improved process for the preparation of a chiral compound of formula (IX) wherein the starting material, the compound of formula (II), is prepared by a novel process which is advantageous over said known prior art processes.\nIt was found that said starting material can be prepared by a process which can be carried out in only one single reaction vessel with good yields, wherein the process consists of only 2 reaction steps. Surprisingly, an olefination concept known as Peterson olefination could be applied for the preparation of above-mentioned allylic chloride. According to this olefination which is first described in \u201cD. J. Peterson, Carbonyl olefination reaction using silyl-substituted organometallic compounds; J. Org. Chem. (1968) 33 (2) pp. 780-784\u201d, an alpha-silyl carbanion is reacted with ketones or aldehydes to form beta-hydroxysilanes which may eliminate to form alkenes. The vast majority of known examples using Peterson olefination are carried in diethyl ether which cannot be used in industrial scale processes due to safety aspects. In rare cases, tetrahydrofuran is described as an alternative solvent.\nAs discussed above, the compounds of formula (IX) and salts thereof are important intermediates for the preparation of antifungal agents. Due to several reasons, the presence of such intermediates as crystalline compounds is advantageous. However, from the known processes of the literature, compounds of formula (IX) and salts thereof, in particular compounds of formula (IX) with both Y1 and Y2 being F, are not obtained as at least partially crystalline compounds.\nTherefore, it was another object of the present invention to provide a process from which the compound according to formula (IX) and salts thereof, in particular compounds of formula (IX) with both Y1 and Y2 being F, are obtained as at least partially crystalline compound.\nIt was yet another object of the present invention to provide the compound according to to formula (IX) and salts thereof, in particular compounds of formula (IX) with both Y1 and Y2 being F, as at least partially crystalline compound.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nTherefore, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a chiral compound of formula (IX)\n              \nor a salt thereof, wherein Y1 and Y2 are independently F or Cl, preferably F, the process comprising\n  (1.1) reacting a compound of formula (I) \n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nwherein L is a leaving group, preferably a halogen, more preferably Cl, in a solvent with a nucleophilic compound comprising a nucleophilic residue RaRbRcSi\u2014CH2 wherein Ra, Rb and Rc are the same or different and selected from the group consisting of optionally suitably substituted alkyl and aryl residues, to obtain a reaction mixture containing as intermediate a beta-hydroxy silane of formula\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n \n(1.2) treating the resulting reaction mixture, preferably without change of solvent, with a reagent promoting elimination reaction to obtain a reaction mixture containing a compound of formula (II)\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nAccording to a particularly preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to a process as defined above wherein the compound of formula (IX) or a salt thereof\n              \nis obtained which contains the cis-isomer of formula (VII) or the salt thereof\n\n              \nas mixture with its trans-isomer of formula (VIII) or the salt thereof\n\n              \nwherein preferably from 80 to 95%, more preferably from 85 to 95% of the molecules of the compound of formula (IX) or the salt thereof are present as cis-isomer of formula (VII) or the salt thereof and preferably from 20 to 5%, more preferably from 15 to 5% of the molecules of the compound of formula (IX) or the salt thereof are present as trans-isomer of formula (VIII) or the salt thereof.\n\nFurther, the present invention relates to a process wherein compound (IX), and thus also compound (VII), is crystallized from a solvent optionally by addition of a suitable antisolvent, wherein the solvent is preferably a polar water-immiscible solvent, preferably an ester such as ethyl acetate or isopropyl acetate, an ether such as tetrahydrofuran or methyl tetrahydrofuran, a ketone such as methyl isobutyl ketone, a halogenated solvent such as dichloromethane, toluene or a mixture of two or more of these solvents, more preferably an ester or an ether, more preferably an ether, and even more preferably methyl tetrahydrofuran, and wherein the antisolvent is preferably a saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon such as cyclohexane, hexane, or heptane, or a mixture of two or more thereof.\nYet further, the present invention relates to a crystalline chiral compound of formula (IX) or a salt thereof\n              \nwherein Y1 and Y2 are independently F or Cl, preferably F, and wherein from 80 to 95%, preferably from 85 to 95% of the molecules of said crystalline compound or the salt thereof are present as cis-isomer of formula (VII) or the salt thereof\n\n              \nand from 20 to 5%, preferably from 15 to 5% of the molecules of said crystalline compound or the salt thereof are present as trans-isomer of formula (VIII) or the salt thereof\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nStill further, the present invention relates to the use of a compound of formula (IX) or a salt thereof, in particular of a preferably at least partially crystalline, preferably a crystalline compound of formula (IX) or a salt thereof, for the preparation of an antifungal agent, preferably posaconazole:\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\n\nLIST OF FIGURES\n FIG. 1 shows the X-ray powder diffraction pattern (XRD) of the compound of formula (IXa) as obtained according to Example 1.

According to the present invention, Y1 and Y2 are independently F or Cl. Thus, Y1 may be F or Cl, and independently from the chemical nature of Y1, Y2 may be F or Cl. Preferably, both Y1 and Y2 are either F or Cl. More preferably, both Y1 and Y2 are F.\nThe term \u201cleaving group L\u201d as used in the context of step (1.1) of the present invention refers to any chemical moieties L which, under suitable reaction conditions, departs from compound (I) with a pair of electrons in a heterolytic bond cleavage. For this purpose, compound (I) as used in the present invention may comprise any suitably leaving group L. Preferably, the leaving group L, after departing, is a neutral or an anionic moiety, more preferably an anionic moiety. Even more preferably, L is an halogen such as, for example, Cl, Br, I. According to an even more preferred embodiment of the present invention, L is Cl.\nThe nucleophilic compound with which compound (I) is reacted in step (1.1) comprises a nucleophilic residue RaRbRcSi\u2014CH2. As to the chemical nature of this residue, there are no particular restrictions provided that the beta-hydroxy silane intermediate of formula\n              \nis obtained. The term \u201cintermediate\u201d as used in this context of the present invention generally refers to a beta-hydroxy silane which is comprised in the reaction mixture obtained in step (1.1) and which is formed from the reactants of step (1.1) and reacts further in (1.2). The term \u201cintermediate\u201d as used in this context does not exclude such beta-hydroxy silanes which can be isolated from the reaction mixture obtained in (1.1)\n\nThe nucleophilic compound employed in (1.1) can be any suitable compound comprising a nucleophilic residue RaRbRcSi\u2014CH2 which, when reacted with compound (I), either directly or indirectly leads to the formation of the beta-hydroxy silane intermediate discussed above. Ra, Rb and Rc comprised in the nucleophilic compound are the same or different and selected from the group consisting of optionally suitably substituted alkyl and aryl residues. The term \u201coptionally suitably substituted aryl residue\u201d as used in the context of the present invention refers to aryl residues which have, for example, up to 6 or up to 12 carbon atoms. If such aryl residue is a substituted aryl residue, the number of carbon atoms refers to the number of carbon atoms of the corresponding unsubstituted aryl residue. The term \u201coptionally suitably substituted alkyl residue\u201d as used in the context of the present invention refers to alkyl residues which have, for example, 1 to 20, preferably 1 to 10 carbon atoms. If such alkyl residue is a substituted alkyl residue, the number of carbon atoms refers to the number of carbon atoms of the corresponding unsubstitued alkyl residue.\nAccording to preferred embodiments of the present invention, Ra, Rb and Rc comprised in the nucleophilic compound are the same or different and selected from the group consisting of alkyl residues, more preferably non-substitued alkyl residues having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably from 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, and tert-butyl, more preferably 1 or 2 carbon atoms, methyl or ethyl, with Ra, Rb and Rc in particular being methyl.\nPreferably, the nucleophilic compound employed in (1.1) is a Grignard reagent. The term \u201cGrignard reagent\u201d as used in this context refers to any suitable nucleophilic organometallic reagent comprising the nucleophilic residue RaRbRcSi\u2014CH2. Preferably the nucleophilic compound is a Grignard compound RaRbRcSi\u2014CH2MgX wherein X is a suitable anionic species which is preferably selected from the group consisting of Cl, Br, and I. More preferably, the Grignard compound is the compound RaRbRcSi\u2014CH2MgCl.\nAs solvent which is employed in (1.1), any solvent or solvent mixture is conceivable, preferably a solvent or solvent mixture in which a Grignard reaction can be carried out. Conceivable solvents are, for example, ether compounds such as the commonly known diethyl ether and/or tetrahydrofuran (THF). Surprisingly, however, it was found in the context of the present invention that the solvents discussed in the background prior art in the context of the Peterson olefination, namely diethyl ether and THF, can be replaced by methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE). This solvent provides the major advantage that compared to compounds such as diethyl ether and THF, no peroxides are formed. Thus, the use of MTBE is especially suitable for industrial scale processes for which safety aspects are of utmost importance. Therefore, according to a particularly preferred embodiment, the solvent used in step (1.1) is MTBE.\nTherefore, according to a preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to a process as defined above, wherein in (1.1), the compound of formula (I) is the compound (Ia)\n              \nwhich is reacted in MTBE as solvent with the nucleophilic compound (H3C)3Si\u2014CH2MgCl to obtain a reaction mixture containing as intermediate a beta-hydroxy silane of the formula:\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nAs to the temperatures at which the reaction in (1.1) is carried out, no particular restrictions exist provided a reaction mixture is obtained which allows for the reaction in (1.2). Preferably, reacting in (1.1) is performed at a temperature in the range of from \u221250 to +20\u00b0 C., more preferably from \u221240 to +15\u00b0 C., more preferably from \u221230 to +10\u00b0 C., more preferably from \u221220 to +10\u00b0 C., more preferably from \u221215 to +5\u00b0 C. such as at a temperature in the range of from \u221215 to \u221210\u00b0 C. or from \u221210 to \u22125\u00b0 C. or from \u22125 to 0\u00b0 C. or from 0 to +5\u00b0 C.\nAs far as the general concept of the Peterson olefination is concerned, the literature teaches a two-step process wherein, after having carried out the Grignard reaction, a solvent exchange is performed. Reference is made to Tetrahedron Letters 32 (1991), pp. 7545-7548. Surprisingly, it was found that after step (1.1) of the present invention, no solvent exchange is necessary, and that the intermediate obtained from (1.1) can be treated with a suitable reagent which promotes elimination reaction in a considerably simplified process.\nTherefore, according to the present invention, the reaction mixture resulting from (1.1) is treated in (1.2), preferably without change of solvent, with a reagent promoting elimination reaction to obtain a reaction mixture containing a compound of formula (II)\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nSince according to the literature, the second step of the Peterson olefination includes the use of BF3*Et2O (boron trifluoride etherate), a further major advantage of the present invention is the fact that the use of potentially hazardous chemicals such as BF3 etherate is completely avoided in this reaction stage. As discussed above, carrying out the inventive process without solvent exchange after (1.1) is particularly preferred if MTBE is used as solvent in (1.1).\nAs to the temperatures at which the reaction in (1.2) is carried out, no particular restrictions exist provided a reaction mixture is obtained containing the compound of formula (II). Preferably, treating in (1.2) is performed at a temperature in the range of from \u221220 to +70\u00b0 C. Preferred temperature ranges are, for example, \u221220 to \u221210\u00b0 C. or \u221210 to 0\u00b0 C. or 0 to +10\u00b0 C. or +10 to +20\u00b0 C. or +20 to +30\u00b0 C. or +30 to +40\u00b0 C. or +40 to +50\u00b0 C. or +50 to +60\u00b0 C. or +60 to +70\u00b0 C.\nAs to the reagent promoting elimination reaction employed in (1.2), no particular restrictions exist provided that the compound of formula (II) is obtained, preferably without solvent exchange after (1.1). Preferably, the reagent is an acid or a mixture of two or more acids. More preferably, the reagent is an inorganic acid or a mixture of two or more inorganic acids. Especially preferred is the use of sulfuric acid. Preferably, if sulfuric acid is used as reagent, the temperature at which (1.2) is performed is in the range of from +40 to +50\u00b0 C.\nTherefore, according to a preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to a process as defined above, wherein in (1.2), the reaction mixture resulting from (1.1) is treated without change of solvent with sulfuric acid promoting elimination reaction to obtain a reaction mixture containing, as compound of formula (II), the compound (IIa):\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nThus, according to a still more preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to a process as defined above which comprises\n  (1.1) reacting a compound of formula (Ia) \n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nwith (H3C)3Si\u2014CH2MgCl in MTBE as solvent to obtain a reaction mixture containing as intermediate a beta-hydroxy silane of formula\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n \n(1.2) treating the resulting reaction mixture without change of the solvent MTBE with sulfuric acid promoting elimination reaction to obtain a reaction mixture containing a compound of formula (IIa)\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nAccording to a still more preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to a process as defined above which comprises\n  (1.1) reacting a compound of formula (Ia) \n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nwith (H3C)3Si\u2014CH2MgCl in MTBE as solvent at a temperature in the range of from \u221215 to +5\u00b0 C. to obtain a reaction mixture containing as intermediate a beta-hydroxy silane of formula\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n \n(1.2) treating the resulting reaction mixture without change of the solvent MTBE at a temperature in the range of from +40 to +50\u00b0 C. with sulfuric acid promoting elimination reaction to obtain a reaction mixture containing a compound of formula (IIa)\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nFrom the compound contained in the reaction mixture obtained in (1.2) as discussed above, the compound of formula (IX) is prepared. As far as specific sequences of individual reaction steps leading from the compound of formula (II) to the compound of formula (IX) are concerned, no particular restrictions exist. According to a preferred sequence of reaction steps, the process of the present invention as defined above further comprises\n  (2) reacting the compound of formula (II) with a malonic ester R1OOC\u2014CH2\u2014COOR2 to obtain a compound of formula (III) \n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nwherein R1 and R2 are independently an optionally suitably substituted alkyl group having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms;\n\n\n(3) reducing the compound of formula (III) to obtain a compound of formula (IV)\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n \n(4) acylating the compound of formula (IV) with isobutyric anhydride to obtain a compound of formula (V)\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n \n(5) reacting the compound of formula (V) with a halogen Hal2 selected from the group consisting of Cl2, Br2 and I2, preferably I2, in the presence of a base in a solvent to obtain a compound of formula (X)\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n \n(6.1) heating the compound of formula (X), preferably in the absence of DMPU (1,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(1H)-pyrimidinone), in a solvent, preferably DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), with a 1,2,4-triazole alkali metal salt, preferably the sodium salt, and treating the resulting reaction mixture with a base, to obtain a compound of formula (IX)\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n \n(6.2) separating the compound of formula (IX) from the reaction mixture obtained from (6.1) by extraction in a suitable solvent.\n\nStep (2)\n\n\nAccording to step (2) of the present invention, the compound of formula (II) is preferably reacted with a malonic ester R1OOC\u2014CH7\u2014COOR2 wherein R1 and R2 are independently an optionally suitably substituted alkyl group having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms. The number of carbon atoms refers to the number of carbon atoms of the unsubstituted alkyl residue. Preferred alkyl groups R1 and R2 have 1 to 4 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, and tert-butyl. Even more preferably the alkyl groups R1 and R2 have 1 or 2 carbon atoms, such as methyl or ethyl, with ethyl being especially preferred. Even more preferably, the alkyl groups R1 and R2 are unsubstituted alkyl groups.\nIn step (2), it is further preferred to react the malonic ester R1OOC\u2014CH2\u2014COOR2 with compound (II) in the presence of a suitable strong base, preferably a strong alkali metal base allowing for the reaction of the respective anion \u2212CH(COOR1)(COOR2) derived from the malonic ester R1OOC\u2014CH2\u2014COOR2. As alkali metal, sodium is preferred. Suitable bases are, for example, NaH or NaOH, with NaOH being preferred. NaOH can be employed in every suitable form. According to a preferred embodiment, NaOH is employed as solid, such as, for examples, in the form of NaOH flakes. The solvent in which step (2) is carried out can be chosen according to, for example, the specific chemical nature of the strong base as discussed above. Conceivable solvents are, for example, THF, DMSO or the like. According to present invention, DMSO is preferred. The temperatures at which the reaction in step (2) is carried out can be chosen in accordance with the solvent and the base. Preferred temperatures are in the range of from 0 to 35\u00b0 C., more preferably from 25 to 30\u00b0 C.\nThe product of the reaction in (2), the compound of formula (III)\n              \nis preferably suitably separated from the reaction mixture obtained in (2). According to a preferred embodiment, this separation includes a step wherein the compound (III) is separated by extraction in a suitable solvent. Among the suitable solvents, cyclohexane is preferred according to present invention.\n\nThe organic layer obtained from extraction can be washed in one or more steps. As washing agents, water and aqueous basic solutions such as, for example, aqueous solutions of alkali metal bases such as alkali metal hydroxide, preferably sodium hydroxide, are to be mentioned.\nStep (3)\nAccording to a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, the compound of formula (III) obtained from step (2) is suitably reduced wherefrom a compound of formula (IV) is obtained:\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nReducing in step (3) can be carried out according to any suitable method involving any suitable reducing agent. According to the present invention, the use of a hydride reducing agent is preferred. Such hydride reducing agents are, for example, sodium borohydride (NaBH4), lithium borohydride (LiBH4), lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH4), diisobutylaluminium hydride (DIBAL) or lithium triethylborohydride (LiEt3BH). According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, LiBH4 is employed as reducing agent in step (3).\nAccording to the prior art, at least 3 molar equivalents of LiBH4 have to be employed with regard to the compound of formula (III). Reference is made to WO 94/25452, page 31, section \u201cPreparation 5\u201d. Surprisingly, however, contrary to the teaching of the prior art, the reducing agent LiBH4 can be employed in a much lower excess with regard to the malonic ester compound (III). The improved process of the present invention uses at most 2 molar equivalents of LiBH4 with regard to the compound of formula (III), which means that compared to the prior art, at least 33% of reducing agent can be saved. Thus, in particular for an industrial scale process, the present invention provides economical and ecological advantages. Thus, the present invention relates a process as defined above, wherein LiBH4 is used as reducing agent which is preferably used in an amount of at most 2 molar equivalents with respect to compound (III).\nAs to the solvent in which the reaction of step (3) is carried out, no particular restrictions exist provided that the compound of formula (IV) is obtained. Preferred solvents are selected from the group consisting of water, alcohol, and a mixture of water and at least one alcohol. Preferred alcohols are methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol. Therefore, the solvent is preferably selected from the group consisting of water, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and a mixture of water and at least one of these alcohols, more preferably from the group consisting of water, ethanol, isopropanol, and a mixture of water and at least one of these alcohols, more preferably from the group consisting of water, isopropanol, and a mixture of water and isopropanol.\nSurprisingly, it was found that in particular for the most preferred reducing agent used in step (3), LiBH4, a mixture of water and isopropanol is the most advantageous solvent. Contrary to the fact that water is known as decomposing hydride reducing agent, the presence of water was found to be advantageous in step (3) of the inventive process. Without wanting to be bound to any theory, it is believed that this could be due to the fact that a certain amount of water improves the solubility of the reagent LiBH4, and/or of its precursors NaBH4 and LiCl, and thus enhances the reaction rate, and thus in turn overcompensates the decomposition of the reducing agent. Therefore, according to still further embodiments, the solvent used in step (3) comprises water, wherein the solvent preferably comprises from 1 to 20 vol.-%, more preferably from 5 to 15 vol.-% of water.\nThe temperatures at which the reaction in step (3) is carried out can be chosen in accordance with the solvent and the reducing agent. Preferred temperatures are in the range of from 0 to 40\u00b0 C., more preferably from 20 to 35\u00b0 C., more preferably from 25 to 30\u00b0 C.\nThe product of the reduction in (3), the compound of formula (IV), is preferably suitably separated from the reaction mixture obtained in (3). According to a preferred embodiment, this separation includes a step wherein the compound (IV) is separated by extraction in a suitable solvent. Among the suitable solvents, toluene is preferred according to the present invention.\nStep (4)\nAccording to step (4) of the present invention, the compound of formula (IV) is preferably acylated with isobutyric anhydride to obtain a compound of formula (V)\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nMore preferably acylation in (4) is carried out in the presence of a suitable enzyme, preferably Novo SP 435 enzyme in a suitable solvent, preferably acetonitrile or toluene, more preferably toluene, e.g. analogously to the method described in WO 97/22710. The choice of toluene as solvent is also beneficial in extractive work up as no additional solvent is required. In case of acetonitrile as solvent it is required to use an additional immiscible solvent for extractive work up.\nThe temperatures at which the acylation in step (4) is carried out can be chosen in accordance with the solvent, the acylation agent and the enzyme. Preferred temperatures are in the range of from \u221220 to \u22125\u00b0 C., more preferably from \u221215 to \u221210\u00b0 C., more preferably from 25 to 30\u00b0 C.\nThe obtained reaction mixture is preferably further treated with a suitable base such as, for example, sodium hydrogencarbonate.\nAccording to an especially preferred embodiment of the present invention, the compound of formula (V) is suitably crystallized from the reaction mixture. Therefore, the present invention also relates to a process as defined above wherein after (4) and before (5), the compound of formula (V) is at least partially crystallized. Crystallization can be carried out according to any conceivable method. According to a preferred embodiment, the compound if formula (V) is crystallized from n-heptane.\nStep (5)\nAccording to step (5) of the present invention, the compound of formula (V) is preferably reacted with a halogen Hal2 selected from the group consisting of Cl2, Br2 and I2, to preferably I2, in the presence of a base in a solvent to obtain a compound of formula (VI)\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nGenerally, it is possible to carry out the reaction in step (5) in the presence of a base such as pyridine and in a suitable solvent such as acetonitrile, THF, EtOAc (ethyl acetate) or CH2Cl2 (dichloromethane, DCM) at a temperature in the range of from \u221220 to +30\u00b0 C. Reference is made to WO 94/25452 A1, pages 16 and 35. However, in the context of the present invention, it was found that the reaction is suitably carried out in ethyl acetate as solvent wherein as base, sodium hydrogencarbonate is employed. Thus, the present invention provides a process which allows for replacing the non-harmless base pyridine. Further, it was found that the temperature for carrying out the reaction is preferably less than 0\u00b0 C., more preferably not higher than \u22125\u00b0 C. and even more preferably not higher than \u221210\u00b0 C.\nAfter the reaction, the organic layer, optionally after suitable quenching, may be optionally washed at least once. Quenching may be done e.g. using a 10% (w/v) aqueous solution of sodium sulphite.\nAccording to a particularly preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to a process as defined above wherein the compound of formula (VI), the cis-isomer, is obtained in step (5) together with the compound of formula (XI), the respective trans-isomer\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nThis mixture of the compounds of formula (VI) and (XI) is referred to in the following as compound of formula (X)\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nIn said compound (X), according to the present invention, preferably from 80 to 95%, more preferably from 85 to 95% of the molecules are present as cis-isomer of formula (VI) and preferably from 20 to 5%, more preferably from 15 to 5% of the molecules of compound (X) are present as trans-isomer of formula (XI).\nTherefore, the present invention also relates to the process as defined above, further comprising\n  (5) reacting the compound of formula (V) with a halogen Hal2 selected from the group consisting of Cl2, Br2 and I2, preferably I2, in the presence of a base in a solvent to obtain a compound of formula (X) \n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nwherein preferably from 80 to 95%, more preferably from 85 to 95% of the molecules of compound (X) are present as cis-isomer of formula (VI) and preferably from 20 to 5%, more preferably from 15 to 5% of the molecules of compound (X) are present as trans-isomer of formula (XI).\n\n\n\nThe compound of formula (X) is suitable for the preparation of a compound of formula (IX) as herein described.\nStep (6.1)\nAccording to step (6.1) of the present invention, the compound of formula (X), i.e. in particular the compound of formula (VI) and the compound of formula (XI), is preferably suitably heated in a suitable solvent with a suitable 1,2,4-triazole salt. Preferred 1,2,4-triazole salts are alkali metal salts, with the sodium salt being especially preferred. Preferred solvents are polar aprotic solvents, for example, DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide) and DMSO, with DMSO being preferred.\nThe temperature to which the reaction mixture in step (6.1) is heated is preferably in the range of from +70 to +100\u00b0 C., preferably from +80 to +95\u00b0 C. and more preferably from +85 to +90\u00b0 C.\nAs to such reactions with a triazole salt, WO 94/25452 teaches that such heating has to be carried out in the presence of 1,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(1H)-pyrimidinone (DMPU). Reference is made to page 17, step (1), and page 39, step (b) of WO 94/25452. Surprisingly, contrary to the teaching in WO 94/25452, it was found that heating the compound of formula (X) in step (6.1) can be performed in the absence of DPMU. Thus, according to the considerably improved process of the present invention, a simplified solvent system is provided which, according to a preferred embodiment, consists of DMSO only, i.e. of only one solvent compound contrary to the mandatory 2 compound system as taught in WO 94/25452.\nThe mixture obtained from heating is then preferably treated with a suitable base to promote saponification of the ester moiety. Such bases are, for example, alkali metal hydroxides, alkali metal bicarbonates, alkali metal carbonates, alkaline earth metal hydroxides, alkaline earth metal bicarbonates, and alkaline earth metal carbonates. The alkali metal bases are preferred. Preferably, the base is added in aqueous and/or alcoholic media. Suitable alcohols are alcohols containing 1 to 6, preferably 1 to 4, more preferably 1 to 3, most preferably 1 to 2 carbon atoms. According to the present invention, it was found that a preferred base is sodium hydroxide, preferably employed as aqueous solution, in the presence of methanol.\nAccording to the present invention, in step (6.1), a compound of formula (IX)\n              \nis obtained, wherein preferably from 80 to 95%, more preferably from 85 to 95% of the molecules are present as cis-isomer of formula (VII)\n\n              \nand preferably from 20 to 5%, more preferably from 15 to 5% of the molecules are present as trans-isomer of formula (VIII)\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nAccording to the prior art, it is necessary to separate the compound of formula (IX) and thus of formula (VII), after reaction steps corresponding to step (6.1) of the present invention by chromatography. Reference is made to WO 94/25452, page 39, step (b). Thus, the prior art explicitly teaches that a costly and time-consuming purification has to be performed which renders the known process considerably detrimental concerning its industrial-scale application.\nContrary to the teaching of the prior art, it was found in the context of the present invention that no such separation by chromatography has to be carried out if the specific sequence of steps (6.1) and extraction in (6.2), preferably followed by crystallization in a step (7) and/or salt formation in a step (8) as described below is carried out. Thus, this modification represents a considerable improvement over the prior art processes.\nStep (6.2)\nAccording to step (6.2) of the present invention, the compound of formula (IX)\n              \nin particular the compound of formula (VII)\n\n              \nand the compound of formula (VIII),\n\n              \ncomprised in the mixture obtained from step (6.1) is suitably separated, preferably by extraction into a suitable solvent.\n\nPreferred solvents according to the present invention are polar water-immiscible solvents. More preferably, the solvent is an ester such as ethyl acetate or isopropyl acetate, an ether such as tetrahydrofuran or methyl tetrahydrofuran, a ketone such as methyl isobutyl ketone, a halogenated solvent such as dichloromethane, toluene, or a mixture of two or more of these solvents, more preferably an ester or an ether, more preferably an ether, and even more preferably methyl tetrahydrofuran.\nAfter separation by extraction, at least one washing stage may be carried out. Among others, washing with an aqueous sodium chloride solution may be mentioned.\nTherefore, according to a preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to a process defined above, comprising\n  (1.1) reacting a compound of formula (Ia) \n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nwith (H3C)3Si\u2014CH2MgCl in MTBE as solvent to obtain a reaction mixture containing as intermediate a beta-hydroxy silane of formula\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n \n(1.2) treating the resulting reaction mixture without change of the solvent MTBE with sulfuric acid promoting elimination reaction to obtain a reaction mixture containing a compound of formula (IIa)\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n \n(2) reacting the compound of formula (IIa) with a malonic ester H3CH2COOC\u2014CH2\u2014COOCH2CH3 to obtain a compound of formula (IIIa)\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n \n(3) reducing the compound of formula (IIIc) using LiBH4 as reducing agent which is used in an amount of at most 2 molar equivalents with respect to compound (IIIa) in a mixture of water and isopropanol as solvent to obtain a compound of formula (IVa)\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n \n(4) acylating the compound of formula (IVa) with isobutyric anhydride in the presence to of Novo SP 435 enzyme in toluene as solvent to obtain a compound of formula (Va)\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n \n(5) reacting the compound of formula (Va) with I2 in the presence of sodium hydrogencarbonate as base in ethyl acetate as solvent to obtain a compound of formula (Xa)\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nwherein preferably from 80 to 95%, more preferably from 85 to 95% of the molecules of compound (Xa) are present as cis-isomer of formula (VIa)\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nand preferably from 20 to 5%, more preferably from 15 to 5% of the molecules of compound (Xa) are present as trans-isomer of formula (XIa)\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n \n(6.1) heating the compound of formula (Xa), preferably in the absence of DMPU (1,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(1H)-pyrimidinone), in DMSO as solvent with 1,2,4-triazole sodium salt and treating the resulting reaction mixture with sodium hydroxide, to obtain a compound of formula (IXa)\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nwherein in the compound of formula (IXa), from 80 to 95%, preferably from 85 to 95% of the molecules are present as cis-isomer of formula (VIIa)\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nand from 20 to 5%, preferably from 15 to 5% of the molecules are present as trans-isomer of formula (VIIIa)\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n \n(6.2) separating the compound of formula (IXa)\n\n              \nfrom the reaction mixture obtained from (6.1) by extraction with methyl tetrahydrofuran.\n\nAccording to one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the compound of formula (IX) and thus also of formula (VII) as obtained from step (6.2) is suitably and at least partially crystallized in a step (7). Therefore, the present invention also relates to a process as defined above, which further comprises\n  (7) at least partially crystallizing the compound of formula (IX), in particular the compound of formula (VII) and the compound of formula (VIII), after (6.2),\n\nStep (7)\n \nAs far as this crystallization is concerned, no particular restrictions exist. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the solvent from which the compound of formula (IX), in particular the compound of formula (VII) and the compound of formula (VIII), is crystallized is the solvent which has been employed in step (6.2) discussed above for the extraction purposes. Therefore, preferred solvents of step (7) are polar water-immiscible solvents. More preferably, the solvent is an ester such as ethyl acetate or isopropyl acetate, an ether such as tetrahydrofuran or methyl tetrahydrofuran, a ketone such as methyl isobutyl ketone, a halogenated solvent such as dichloromethane, toluene, or a mixture of two or more of these solvents, more preferably an ester or an ether, more preferably an ether, and even more preferably methyl tetrahydrofuran.\nEven more preferably, after step (6.2), no solvent exchange is performed. Thus, according to this preferred embodiment, the compound of formula (IX), in particular the compound of formula (VII) and the compound of formula (VIII), is crystallized from the mixture obtained in step (6.2) without addition of a further suitable solvent different from the solvent employed in step (6.2).\nGenerally, such crystallization can be carried out according to any suitable method. Among others, cooling the mixture obtained from (6.2), addition of an antisolvent to the mixture obtained from (6.2), suitable chemical reaction, change of the pH in the mixture obtained from (6.2), solvent distillation, or a combination of two or more of these methods may be mentioned.\nAccording to a still further preferred embodiment, this crystallization in step (7) is carried out by adding a suitable antisolvent. Generally, depending on the solvent employed in (6.2), every conceivable antisolvent can be employed provided that this antisolvent allows for reducing the solubility of the dissolved compound of formula (IX), in particular the compound of formula (VII) and the compound of formula (VIII), to such an extent that the compound of formula (IX) is at least partially crystallized. Preferably, the antisolvent is a saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon such as cyclohexane, hexane, or heptane, or a mixture of two or more thereof. Even more preferably, the antisolvent used in step (7) is selected from the group consisting of cyclohexane, hexane, heptane, and a mixture of two or more thereof, in particular heptane.\nGenerally, the temperatures at which crystallization in step (7) is performed are adjusted to the solvent and preferably the antisolvent used. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, addition of the antisolvent is performed at a temperature in the range of from 40 to 70\u00b0 C., preferably from 45 to 65\u00b0 C., and more preferably from 50 to 60\u00b0 C. Thereafter, it is preferred to cool the resulting mixture continuously to a preset temperature wherein cooling can be carried out continuously, or step-wise in two or more steps. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the preset temperature to which the mixture is ultimately cooled is in the range of from \u221215 to 0\u00b0 C., preferably from \u221210 to 0\u00b0 C., more preferably from \u22125 to 0\u00b0 C. Cooling the mixture to this temperature can, as mentioned above, involve at least one temperature range to which the mixture is cooled in a first step, held at this temperature, and then further cooled to the final temperature discussed above. For example, such temperature range to which the mixture can be cooled in a first step is from 20 to 35\u00b0 C., preferably from 25 to 30\u00b0 C.\nAfter crystallization, the crystallized compound of (IX), in particular the crystallized compound of formula (VII) and the crystallized compound of formula (VIII), is preferably separated from the mother liquor, for example by suitable filtration, and preferably washed at least once with a suitable washing agent. Preferred washing agents are the solvent mixture used for the crystallization and the antisolvent discussed above. After such preferred separation, the crystallized compound of formula (IX), in particular the crystallized compound of formula (VII) and the crystallized compound of formula (VIII), is preferably dried under suitable drying conditions. Drying in vacuo is preferred wherein the temperatures are preferably in the range of from 20 to 50\u00b0 C., more preferably from 30 to 45\u00b0 C.\nAccording to the process of the present invention, and as described above, the crystalline chiral compound of formula (VII), the cis-isomer\n              \nis obtained as mixture with its diasteromeric form, the crystalline compound of formula (VIII), namely the trans-isomer\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nThe molar ratio of the cis-isomer to the trans-isomer generally depends on the overall process conditions. According to preferred process conditions of the process of the present invention, the crystallized compound of formula (IX) obtained after step (7),\n              \ncontains from 80 to 95%, preferably from 85 to 95% of the cis-isomer (VII) and from 20 to 5%, preferably from 15 to 5% of the trans-isomer (VIII). Therefore, the present invention also relates to the process as defined above, wherein an at least partially crystalline chiral compound of formula (IX)\n\n              \nis obtained, wherein from 80 to 95%, preferably from 85 to 95% of the molecules of said crystalline compound are present as the cis-isomer of formula (VII)\n\n              \nand from 20 to 5%, preferably from 15 to 5% of the molecules of said crystalline compound are present as the trans-isomer of formula (VIII)\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nAccording to the prior art, the preparation of the crystalline compound of formula (IX), i.e. a crystalline mixture preferably containing 80 to 95%, more preferably from 85 to 95% of the cis-isomer (VII), and preferably from 20 to 5%, more preferably from 15 to 5% of the trans-isomer of (VIII), are not taught. Reference is made to WO 94/25452, page 39, step (b) where it is disclosed that costly and time-consuming purification by column chromatography has to be performed which leads to non at least partly crystalline compound (IX). However, it is believed that the mixture of compounds (VII) and (VIII) as obtained according to the present invention can be similarly used as key compound for further reactions, in particular as key compound for the preparation of an antifungal agent such as, in particular, posaconazole.\nThus, the present invention also relates to a crystalline chiral compound of formula (IX) or a salt thereof\n              \nwherein Y1 and Y2 are independently F or Cl, preferably F, and wherein from 80 to 95%, preferably from 85 to 95% of the molecules of said crystalline compound or the salt thereof are present as cis-isomer of formula (VII) or the salt thereof\n\n              \nand from 20 to 5%, preferably from 15 to 5% of the molecules of said crystalline compound or the salt thereof are present as trans-isomer of formula (VIII) or the salt thereof\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nThe crystalline chiral compound of formula (IX) as herein described, wherein Y1 and Y2 are F, preferably exhibits the following X-ray diffraction pattern comprising at least the following reflections:\n              Diffraction angle \u00b02 Theta [Cu K(alpha 1)] Relative Intensity (%)                     7.05 19   8.03 51   9.25 20   11.92 24   13.79 36   15.88 25   16.65 100   20.15 42   21.37 45   22.04 37   24.04 96   27.80 20          \nwherein 100% relates to the intensity of the maximum peak in the X-ray diffraction pattern.\n\nBased on the crystalline compound of formula (IX) preferably containing from 80 to 95%, preferably from 85 to 95% of the cis-isomer (VII) and from 20 to 5%, preferably from 15 to 5% of the trans-isomer (VIII), suitable salts of the crystalline free base (IX) can be prepared. All salts are conceivable. In particular, these salts can be prepared by treating the compound of formula (IX) and, thus, the compound of formula (VII), with at least one suitable inorganic acid and/or at least one suitable organic acid, preferably at least one suitable inorganic Bronstedt acid and/or at least one suitable organic Bronstedt acid, optionally in at least one suitable solvent. Such suitable organic acids include, but are not limited to fumaric acid, oxalic acid, and tartaric acid. The suitable inorganic acids include, but are not limited to hydrochloric acid.\nTherefore, the present invention also relates to the process as defined above, which further comprises\n  (8) converting the compound of formula (IX), in particular the compound of formula (VII) and the compound of formula (VIII), to the respective salt by treating the compound with an inorganic or organic Bronstedt acid in a suitable solvent and preferably at least partially crystallizing the respective salt. \nAmong other, the fumaric acid salt or the oxalic acid or the tartaric acid salt or the hydrochloric acid salt of compound (IX) is preferred. The hydrochloric acid salt is even more preferred.\nSuitable solvents according to the present invention are polar solvents. More preferably, the solvent is an ester such as ethyl acetate or isopropyl acetate, an ether such as dioxane, tetrahydrofuran or methyl tetrahydrofuran, a ketone such as acetone or methyl isobutyl ketone, a halogenated solvent such as dichloromethane, toluene, or a mixture of two or more of these solvents, more preferably a ketone is used as solvent. Most preferably the solvent is acetone.\nGenerally, such crystallization can be carried out according to any suitable method. Among others, cooling, addition of an antisolvent, solvent distillation, or a combination of two or more of these methods may be mentioned.\nAccording to a preferred embodiment, this crystallization is carried out by adding a suitable antisolvent together with the acid or after the addition of the acid. Generally, every conceivable antisolvent can be employed provided that this antisolvent allows for reducing the solubility of the dissolved acid addition salt of compound of formula (IX) and thus also of formula (VII) to such an extent that the acid addition salt of compound (IX) and thus also of compound (VII) is at least partially crystallized. Preferably, the antisolvent is an ether such as MTBE or a saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon such as cyclohexane, hexane, or heptane. More preferably the antisolvent is MTBE.\nAccording to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the compound of formula (IX) and thus also of formula (VII) as obtained from step (6.2) is directly converted into a suitable salt as herein described, namely by applying the salt formation and preferably also the at least partial crystallization described in step (8) without applying the crystallization of step (7). Optionally, a solvent change is performed after (6.2) prior to the salt formation.\nAlso in this embodiment of the present invention wherein step (7) is not performed, the fumaric acid salt or the oxalic acid salt or the tartaric acid salt or the hydrochloric acid salt of compound (IX) is preferred. The hydrochloric acid salt is even more preferred. Suitable solvents according to the present invention are polar solvents. More preferably, the solvent is an ester such as ethyl acetate or isopropyl acetate, an ether such as dioxane, tetrahydrofuran or methyl tetrahydrofuran, a ketone such as acetone or methyl isobutyl ketone, a halogenated solvent such as dichloromethane, toluene, or a mixture of two or more of these solvents, more preferably a ketone is used as solvent. Most preferably the solvent is acetone. Generally, such crystallization can be carried out according to any suitable method. Among others, cooling, addition of an antisolvent, solvent distillation, or a combination of two or more of these methods may be mentioned. According to a preferred embodiment, this crystallization is carried out by adding a suitable antisolvent together with the acid or after the addition of the acid. Generally, every conceivable antisolvent can be employed provided that this antisolvent allows for reducing the solubility of the dissolved acid addition salt of compound of formular (IX) to such an extent that the acid addition salt of compound (IX) is at least partially crystallized. Preferably, the antisolvent is an ether such as MTBE or a saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon such as cyclohexane, hexane, or heptane. More preferably the antisolvent is MTBE.\nThus, the present invention also relates to a crystalline hydrochloric acid salt of a chiral compound of formula (IX)\n              \nwherein Y1 and Y2 are independently F or Cl, preferably F, and wherein from 80 to 95%, preferably from 85 to 95% of the molecules of said crystalline compound or the hydrochloride acid salt thereof are present as cis-isomer of formula (VII)\n\n              \nand from 20 to 5%, preferably from 15 to 5% of the molecules of said crystalline compound or the hydrochlorid acid salt thereof are present as trans-isomer of formula (VII)\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n \n\n\n\nThe crystalline hydrochloric acid salt of chiral compound of formula (IX) as herein described, wherein Y1 and Y2 are F, preferably exhibits the following X-ray diffraction pattern comprising at least the following reflections:\n              Diffraction angle \u00b02 Theta [Cu K(alpha 1)] Relative Intensity (%)                     11.08 26   16.26 30   17.15 22   17.69 51   19.19 17   20.29 15   21.00 49   21.44 42   22.56 100   24.29 43   24.66 32   27.14 34   27.56 57          \nwherein 100% relates to the intensity of the maximum peak in the X-ray diffraction pattern.\n\nFurther, the present invention relates to a preferably at least partially crystalline chiral compound or a salt thereof which is obtainable or obtained by a process as defined above, the process preferably comprising steps (1) to (8), even more preferably comprising steps (1) to (6.2) followed by (8).\nAs already mentioned above, the compound of formula (IX) or a salt thereof is preferably used as key compound for the preparation of an antifungal agent.

A solution of 14 ml of the CM-TMS in 43 ml of MTBE was added slowly over a period of 2 hours at a temperature of 55\u00b0 C. The mixture was stirred for 2 hours at 55\u00b0 C. and then cooled to a temperature of \u221210\u00b0 C. Subsequently, 10.0 g of the commercial compound of formula (Ia) (CAS Registry Number: 51336-94-8; commercially available from Sigma-Aldrich) in 30 ml of MTBE were added and the temperature was kept in the range of from 0 to \u221210\u00b0 C. The reaction mixture was quenched in a 20% (w/v) aqueous solution of ammonium chloride. The obtained organic layer was washed with a 20% (w/v) aqueous solution of ammonium chloride. The thus washed organic layer was then washed with water.\nTo the organic layer, 11.0 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid were added, and the temperature was kept at 25 to 30\u00b0 C. Then, the reaction mixture was stirred at a temperature of from 45 to 50\u00b0 C. for 3 hours. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was cooled to 20\u00b0 C. and 25 ml of water were added, and the organic layer was separated. The obtained organic layer was extracted with an 9% (w/v) aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate, followed by washing with water. The solvents of the washed organic layer were removed by distillation under reduced pressure, and the compound of formula (IIa) was obtained as an oil. The yield was 9.4 g, corresponding to a theoretical value of 95%.\n(b) Preparation of the Compound of Formula (IIIa)\n10.0 g of the compound of formula (IIa) (as oil, as obtained according to (a)) were dissolved in 20 ml of DMSO under stirring. Then, 3.2 g of NaOH flakes and 24.0 ml of diethyl malonate were added. The resulting suspension was stirred for 5 hours at 25 to 30\u00b0 C. Subsequently, 100 ml of water were added, and the resulting mixture was stirred for 30 min. The thus obtained solution was extracted with 80 ml of cyclohexane at 25 to 30\u00b0 C. After separation of the layers the aqueous layer was extracted with 40 ml of cyclohexane at 25 to 30\u00b0 C. The combined organic layers were washed with a 5% (w/v) aqueous solution of NaOH, followed by washing with water. After washing, the solvents of the organic layer were removed by distillation under reduced pressure and the compound of formula (IIIa) was obtained as an oil. The yield was 15.0 g, corresponding to a theoretical value of 90.0%.\n(c) Preparation of the Compound of Formula (IVa)\n10.0 g of the compound of formula (IIIa) (as oil, as obtained according to (b)) were dissolved in 120 ml of isopropyl alcohol and 13.0 ml of water under stirring at 25 to 30\u00b0 C. The resulting mixture was cooled to a temperature of from 0 to \u22125\u00b0 C. Then, 2.3 g of lithium chloride and 2.1 g of sodium borohydride were added at 0 to \u22125\u00b0 C. The resulting suspension was stirred at 25 to 30\u00b0 C. for 20 hours. The pH of the stirred mixture was adjusted to a value of 1 (measured by using a calibrated pH meter) by addition of 4 N aqueous HCl. Afterwards, an 20% (w/v) aqueous solution of NaOH was added to adjust the pH to a value of 10 (measured by using a calibrated pH meter). The resulting mixture was stirred for 1 hour. Then, the lower aqueous layer was drained. From the separated organic layer, the isopropyl alcohol was distilled off, and an oil was obtained. To the oil, 100 ml of toluene and 100 ml of water were added, and the product was extracted into the toluene layer. The solvents of the resulting toluene layer were removed by distillation, under reduced pressure and the compound of formula (IVa) was obtained as oil. The yield was 6.0 g, corresponding to a theoretical value of 82.0%.\n(d) Preparation of the Compound of Formula (Va)\n10.0 g of the compound of formula (IVa) (as oil, as obtained according to (c)) were dissolved in 80 ml of toluene and cooled to \u221215\u00b0 C. Then, 7.4 g of sodium bicarbonate, 0.5 g of enzyme (Novo SP 435; Candida antarctica, Novozym 435 from Novo Nordisk), and 7.9 ml of isobutyric anhydride were added. The resulting mixture was stirred at \u221215\u00b0 C. for 24 hours. Then the solids were filtered off and the filtrate was washed with an 5% (w/v) aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate, followed by washing with water. The solvents of the resulting organic layer were removed by distillation under reduced pressure to obtain the desired product as an oil. This oil was dissolved in 40 ml of n-heptane at 50 to 60\u00b0 C. The clear solution was gradually cooled to a temperature of 10\u00b0 C. The compound of formula (Va) crystallized as colorless crystals. The obtained solids were filtered, and the wet filter cake was washed with 20 ml of n-heptane.

The yield was 9.2 g, corresponding to a theoretical value of 70.0%.\n(e) Preparation of the Compound of Formula (Xa)\n10.0 g of the crystals obtained in (d) were dissolved in 80 ml of ethyl acetate under stirring. The resulting solution was cooled to \u221215\u00b0 C., and 21.5 g of iodine and 7.0 g of sodium bicarbonate were added. The obtained suspension was stirred at \u221215\u00b0 C. for 5 hours. The reaction mixture was quenched in 200 ml of a 10% (w/v) aqueous solution of sodium sulphite. The organic layer was washed with 100 ml of a 10% (w/v) aqueous solution of sodium sulphite, followed by washing with water. The solvents of the thus obtained, washed organic layer were removed by distillation under reduced pressure to obtain the compound of formula (Xa) as an oil.

Then, 10 g of the sodium salt of 1,2,4-triazole were added at 25 to 30\u00b0 C., and the resulting reaction mixture was stirred for 24 hours at 85 to 90\u00b0 C. The mixture was then cooled to 25 to 30\u00b0 C., and 25 ml of 5% (w/v) aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide were added. The mixture was then stirred for 3 hours at 25 to 30\u00b0 C. 100 ml of water were added, and the product was extracted into 150 ml of methyl tetrahydrofuran. The thus obtained organic layer was washed with a 10% (w/v) aqueous solution of sodium chloride, and subsequently the solvents of the resulting organic layer were removed by distillation under reduced pressure to obtain the compound of formula (IXa) as a crude oil. The yield was 6.0 g, corresponding to a theoretical value of 86.0%.\n10.0 g of the crude oil were dissolved in 100 ml of methyl tetrahydrofuran under stirring at 50 to 60\u00b0 C. Then, 300 ml of n-heptane were added at 50 to 60\u00b0 C. over a period of 30 min. The turbid solution was cooled to 25 to 30\u00b0 C. and stirred for another 30 min. The resulting suspension was cooled to 0 to \u22125\u00b0 C. and stirred for 2 hours. The product was filtered, and the wet cake was washed with 20 ml of n-heptane. The washed product was dried at 40\u00b0 C. in vacuo to obtain the crystalline compound of formula (IXa) as a colorless solid. The yield was 7.0 g, corresponding to a theoretical value of 70.0%.\nThe compound of formula (IXa) was obtained as mixture of the cis-isomer with the respective trans-isomer with a cis:trans ratio of 9:1.\nExample 2\nPreparation of Salts of the Compound of Formula (IX)\n(a) Preparation of a Hydrochloride Salt\n10.0 g of the compound of formula (IXa) as crude oil as obtained in Example 1 (f) prior to the crystallization were dissolved in 200 ml of acetone under stirring at 30 to 40\u00b0 C. The resulting solution was cooled to 25 to 30\u00b0 C. Then, HCl in MTBE (10 wt.-%) was added over a period of 15 min at 25 to 30\u00b0 C.

The suspension was cooled to 0 to \u22125\u00b0 C. and stirred for 2 hours. The product was filtered, and the wet cake was washed with 20 ml of MTBE. After drying at 70\u00b0 C. in vacuo, the HCl salt of the compound (IXa) was obtained as colourless solid. The yield was 9.5 g, corresponding to a theoretical value of 85.0%.\nThe HCl salt of compound of formula (IXa) was obtained as mixture of the cis-isomer with the respective trans-isomer with a cis:trans ratio of 9:1.\n(b) Preparation of Organic Acid Salts\n10.0 g of the crystalline compound of formula (IXa) as obtained in Example 1 (f) above (cis:trans ratio=9:1) were dissolved in 20 ml of acetone. To the resulting solution, 1.1 molar equivalents of organic acid (oxalic acid, DL-tartaric acid, fumaric acid) were added at ambient temperature of from 25 to 30\u00b0 C. The resulting mixtures were stirred for 1 hour at 25 to 30\u00b0 C. Then, 150 ml of MTBE were added via a dropping funnel over a period of 15 min. The solids crystallized. Stirring was continued at 25 to 30\u00b0 C. for 2 hours. The solids were isolated by filtration, washed with 20 ml of MTBE, and dried in vacuo at 45\u00b0 C.

This application claims foreign priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 and 365 to European Patent Application No. 08159600.9, filed 3 Jul. 2008. This application claims domestic priority under 35 U.S.C. 120 and 365 to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/133,852, filed 3 Jul. 2008. The complete contents of these applications are incorporated herein by reference.\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\nThe present invention relates to crystalline form IV of posaconazole as well as pharmaceutical compositions comprising the same as an active pharmaceutical ingredient. The pharmaceutical composition can be used to treat or prevent fungal infections. Furthermore, methods of preparing crystalline form IV of posaconazole are disclosed.\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\nPosaconazole (CAS Registry Number 171228-49-2; CAS Name: 2,5-anhydro-1,3,4-trideoxy-2-C-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-4-[[4-[4-[4-[1-[(1S,2S)-1-ethyl-2-hydroxypropyl]-1,5-dihydro-5-oxo-4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl]phenyl]-1-piperazinyl]phenoxy]methyl]-1-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-D-threo-pentitol) which is represented by the following general formula (I)\n              \nis known as an antifungal agent. It is available as an oral suspension (40 mg/ml) under the trademark NOXAFIL\u00ae from Schering Corporation, Kenilworth, N.J.\n\nWO95/17407 and WO 96/38443 disclose the compound having the general formula (I) and its use in treating fungal infections.\nA pharmaceutical composition comprising posaconazole, at least one non-ionic surfactant and a diluent is disclosed in WO 02/80678, e.g. in the form of a liquid suspension. WO 02/80678 also describes that for use in its suspension posaconazole is to be micronized, e.g. by microfluidization to obtain a specific particle size in the range of about 1000 nm (nanometers) to about 1800 nm to obtain enhanced bioavailability. The reduction of the particle size is carried out during the preparation of the posaconazole active ingredient and/or during the manufacture of the pharmaceutical composition. A solid solution of posaconazole, which can be provided in the form of a tablet or capsule, is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,972,381. Other pharmaceutical compositions prepared by mixing or granulating posaconazole with a non-ionic surfactant and a diluent which may be formulated into capsules or tablets are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,834,472. A topical form of posaconazole, e.g. a lotion, cream, ointment, or \u201clacquer nail polish\u201d is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,957,730 (PENLAC\u00ae available from Dermik\u00ae). An injectable pharmaceutical suspension comprising posaconazole that is stable when subjected to terminal steam sterilization is disclosed in WO 2005/117831.\nAs was mentioned above, WO 95/17407 and WO 96/38443 disclose the compound having the general formula (I). However, during prosecution of the subsequently filed European patent application no. 98951994.7, now European patent EP 1 021 439 B1, the applicant declared that the methods disclosed in these publications only lead to the compound of formula (I) as an amorphous solid.\nPolymorphism is a phenomenon relating to the occurrence of different crystal forms for one molecule. There may be several different crystalline forms for the same molecule with distinct crystal structures and distinct and varying physical properties like melting point, XRPD spectrum, IR-spectrum and solubility profile. These polymorphs are thus distinct solid forms which share the molecular formula of the compound from which the crystals are made up, however, they may have distinct advantageous physical properties which can have a direct effect on the ability to process and/or manufacture the drug product, like flowability, as well as physical properties such as solubility, stability and dissolution properties which can have a direct effect on drug product stability, dissolution, and bioavailability.\nThree polymorphic forms of posaconazole designated as forms I, II and III are described and characterized in WO 99/18097 (U.S. Pat. No. 6,713,481, U.S. Pat. No. 6,958,337). Crystalline forms II and III were found to be unstable under the conditions investigated, so that crystalline form I was considered to be useful in the development of a pharmaceutical product.\nThere remains a need for alternative polymorphic forms of posaconazole which are more stable than form I when used in a pharmaceutical composition and/or which have properties that make them suitable for bulk preparation and handling. Additionally, there is a need for alternative polymorphic forms of posaconazole which allow improved pharmaceutical processing such as the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions on a commercial scale, in particular without the need to apply time-consuming methods to reduce their particle size. Finally, it would be desirable to provide alternative polymorphic forms of posaconazole which show improved dissolution properties and enhanced bioavailability.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nIn one embodiment the present invention relates to crystalline form IV of posaconazole.\nCrystalline form IV of posaconazole can be described by an X-ray powder diffraction pattern comprising peaks at 2-theta angles of about 3.2\u00b0, 6.6\u00b0, 10.9\u00b0, 16.9\u00b0, 18.4\u00b0 and 25.1\u00b0. The typical precision of the 2-theta values is in the range of \u00b1about 0.2\u00b0.\nAlternatively, crystalline form IV of posaconazole can be characterized by an attenuated total reflectance infrared spectrum comprising absorption bands at wavenumbers of about 3647 cm\u22121, 3472 cm\u22121, 2867 cm\u22121, 1687 cm\u22121, 1512 cm\u22121, 1230 cm\u22121, 1136 cm\u22121, 916 cm\u22121, 853 cm\u22121, 819 cm\u22121 and 681 cm\u22121. The typical precision of the wavenumber values is in the range of \u00b1about 2 cm\u22121.\nA further method of describing crystalline form IV is by differential scanning calorimetry. A typical differential scanning calorimetry curve of crystalline form IV can be obtained at a heating rate of 10\u00b0 C./min (10\u00b0 K/min) and about 2 to 3% mass loss in the TGA analysis (open pan). Typical thermograms of form IV of posaconazole are shown in FIG. 3. It can be seen that the DSC curve of form IV shows a significant dehydration endotherm between about 25\u00b0 C. and about 105\u00b0 C. with a subsequent exothermic conversion at about 116\u00b0 C. (Tonset about 113\u00b0 C.) followed by a peak at about 120\u00b0 C. (Tonset about 117\u00b0 C.) and melting at about 171\u00b0 C. with a Tonset at about 168\u00b0 C. (10\u00b0 C./minute, open pan).\nThe crystalline form IV of posaconazole typically contains 0 to 1.5 moles water per mole posaconazole.\nIn one specific embodiment, crystalline form IV of posaconazole has a specific surface area of about 10-25 m2/g\u00b10.5 m2/g.\nIn another specific embodiment, crystalline form IV of posaconazole has a median particle size of about 0.1-0.2 \u03bcm\u00b10.05 \u03bcm (micrometers).\nCrystalline form IV of posaconazole can be prepared by a process comprising the steps of:\n  (a) providing a suspension or dispersion of:\n     (i) posaconazole, wherein posaconazole is selected from crystalline form III of posaconazole or amorphous posaconazole or a mixture thereof; and (ii) water or a mixture of water and methanol; and \n (b) allowing the posaconazole to transform to crystalline form IV at a temperature of at most 60\u00b0 C. \nIf desired, seed crystals of crystalline form IV of posaconazole can be employed in this process.\nAlternatively crystalline form IV of posaconazole can be prepared by a process comprising the steps of:\n  (a) providing a suspension or dispersion of:\n     (i) posaconazole, wherein posaconazole is selected from crystalline form I or II of posaconazole or a mixture thereof; (ii) water or a mixture of water and methanol; and (iii) seed crystals of crystalline form IV of posaconazole; and \n (b) allowing the posaconazole to transform to crystalline form IV at a temperature of at most 60\u00b0 C. \nIn the present invention the terms \u201csuspension\u201d and \u201cdispersion\u201d are intended to cover all types of mixtures of solid particles and liquids.\nA further embodiment of the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising crystalline form IV of posaconazole and optionally a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\nThe crystalline form IV of posaconazole and pharmaceutical compositions comprising it can be used for treating or preventing a fungal infection.\nSurprisingly, crystalline form IV of posaconazole shows improved stability when used in a pharmaceutical composition such as an aqueous suspension or dispersion, e.g. for oral administration. Additionally, crystalline form IV of posaconazole as such, i.e. in a non-micronized form, has a smaller median particle size and a larger specific surface area when compared to known non-micronized crystalline form I of posaconazole. This smaller particle size and larger specific surface area advantageously result in an improved dissolution behaviour of crystalline form IV which is expected to provide improved bioavailability. Due to these advantageous properties, crystalline form IV of posaconazole may be directly used as such, i.e. without the need of reducing the particle size of its crystals e.g. by micronization, for the preparation of a medicament such as a liquid suspension or dispersion. Therefore, the use of crystalline form IV of posaconazole for preparing such suspension or dispersion avoids complex, time consuming and costly micronization techniques which are generally applied for treating known crystalline form I of posaconazole to achieve the desired bioavailability.\nOther objects, features, advantages and aspects of the present invention will become apparent to those of skill from the following description. It should be understood, however, that the description and the following specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only. Various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the disclosed invention will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from reading the description and the other parts of the present disclosure.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n FIG. 1: X-ray powder diffraction pattern of form IV of posaconazole.

As is mentioned in the scientific discussion, which is available from the website of the EMEA, crystalline form I of posaconazole is used in the medicament NOXAFIL\u00ae. It is further explained that the crystal form is controlled as part of the drug substance specification and that there has been no evidence of polymorphic transition on storage as micronised powder, during manufacture or as formulated in the finished product. This is in line with the findings of the present inventors.\nAmorphous posaconazole can be obtained as described in WO 95/17407 and WO 96/38443. Crystalline forms I, II and III can be prepared as described in WO 99/18097, U.S. Pat. No. 6,713,481 or U.S. Pat. No. 6,958,337.\nThe amorphous posaconazole or the crystalline form III or the mixture thereof, which is used as a starting material is typically employed in the form of a powder or small crystals. The powder or small crystals may be used as such, e.g. as originating from the synthesis or may be milled or micronized before the transformation step.\nThe posaconazole starting material is then mixed with water or a mixture of water and methanol. The ratio of water to methanol (v/v) is not particularly restricted as long as the transformation results in crystalline form IV of posaconazole. Typically the ratio of water to methanol will be in the range of 20:80 to 100:0, preferably 50:50 to 100:0, more preferably 60:40 to 90:10.\nThe posaconazole starting material will be typically provided in a volume of water or a mixture of water and methanol, so that the major part is not dissolved. The mixture is typically a stirrable suspension or dispersion. The exact volume of the water or the mixture of water and methanol will depend on the amount of methanol and the transformation conditions and can therefore vary.\nTypically the weight ratio of posaconazole to water or to the mixture of water and methanol will be in the range of about 0.1 g/100 g to about 20 g/100 g, preferably from about 1 g/100 g to about 20 g/100 g, even more preferably about 2 g/100 g to about 10 g/100 g.\nIf desired, seed crystals of crystalline form IV of posaconazole can also be present in the mixture to aid transformation.\nThe mixture of posaconazole, water or mixture of water and methanol and optionally seed crystals is then slurried, so that the posaconazole can transform to crystalline form IV.\nThe temperature at which the transformation can be conducted will depend on the chosen solvent (i.e. water or a mixture of water and methanol), on the form of posaconazole which is used as a starting material, etc. Typical temperatures for conducting the transformation are about 10\u00b0 C. to about 60\u00b0 C., preferably about 20\u00b0 C. to about 55\u00b0 C., and more preferably ambient temperature (i.e. about 20 to about 30\u00b0 C.). The temperature can also vary during the transformation step. However, the suspension or dispersion is not subjected to a refluxing step during the presently claimed processes.\nIn a preferred embodiment a mixture of water and methanol in the ratio of 4:1 (v/v) is used in steps (a) and (b) of the above described processes and the preferred temperature range is about 15\u00b0 C. to about 50\u00b0 C.\nThe duration of the transformation step is not particularly limited. Generally, the transformation will be conducted until substantially all (e.g., preferably at least 90 wt.-%, more preferably at least 95 wt.-%) of the posaconazole starting material has been transformed into crystalline form IV. Typically for 1 g starting material the transformation step will take from about 1 day to about 20 days, preferably from about 2 days to about 15 days at ambient temperature, if seed crystals are not employed. The transformation will be quicker, e.g. from about 1 hour to about 5 days, preferably about 2 hours to about 4 days at ambient temperature, if seed crystals are employed. If the mixture is kept at a higher temperature the speed of transformation will also be increased. In case water is used to provide the suspension or dispersion mentioned in step (a) of the herein described processes and no seed crystals are employed, the transformation step will take at least about 4 to 7 days at ambient temperature. A skilled person can easily determine appropriate transformation durations according to the batch size, temperature of the suspension/dispersion, presence or absence of seed crystals, etc.\nAfter the transformation step, the product is isolated. Transformation to crystalline form IV can be confirmed by IR or XRPD analysis as described herein.\nThe resultant crystalline form IV is a polymorphic form of posaconazole. Unlike form II which is a monohydrate and form I which is anhydrous, form IV is a nonstoichiometric hydrate. It typically has a stoichiometry of from 1:0 to 1:1.5 (mole:mole) of posaconazole:water.\nCrystalline form IV can be characterized by an X-ray powder diffraction pattern comprising peaks at 2-theta angles of about 3.2\u00b0, 6.6\u00b0, 10.9\u00b0, 16.9\u00b0, 18.4\u00b0 and 25.1\u00b0 (\u00b1 about 0.2\u00b0). A characteristic X-ray powder diffraction pattern is shown in FIG. 1.\nAlternatively, crystalline form IV can be characterized by an attenuated total reflectance infrared spectrum comprising absorption bands at wavenumbers of about 3647 cm\u22121, 3472 cm\u22121, 2867 cm\u22121, 1687 cm\u22121, 1512 cm\u22121, 1230 cm\u22121, 1136 cm\u22121, 916 cm\u22121, 853 cm\u22121, 819 cm\u22121 and 681 cm\u22121 (\u00b1 about 2 cm\u22121). A typical attenuated total reflectance infrared spectrum is shown in FIG. 2.\nA further method for identifying crystalline form IV is differential scanning calorimetry. A typical differential scanning calorimetry curve of crystalline form IV can be obtained at a heating rate of 10\u00b0 C./min (10\u00b0 K/min) and about 2 to 3% mass loss in the TGA analysis (open pan). The DSC curve of form IV shows a significant dehydration endotherm between about 25\u00b0 C. and about 105\u00b0 C. with a subsequent exothermic conversion at about 116\u00b0 C. (Tonset about 113\u00b0 C.) followed by a peak at about 120\u00b0 C. (Tonset about 117\u00b0 C.) and melting at about 171\u00b0 C. with a Tonset at about 168\u00b0 C. (10\u00b0 C./minute; open pan). A characteristic curve is shown in FIG. 3.\nCrystalline form IV of posaconazole is preferably substantially pure and substantially free of other polymorphic forms or of amorphous posaconazole. Thus, crystalline form IV of posaconazole preferably shows a polymorphic purity of at least about 90 wt.-%, more preferably of at least about 95 wt.-% and most preferably of at least about 98 wt.-% as measured by XRPD analysis as herein described.\nThe present inventors have surprisingly found that the new polymorph, crystalline form IV, has improved stability when used in a pharmaceutical composition such as in an aqueous suspension or dispersion, e.g. for oral administration, as herein described. Furthermore, crystalline form IV is suitable for bulk preparation and handling. In addition it has the water solubility required for the preparation of the above mentioned pharmaceutical composition.\nAdvantageously, crystalline form IV is expected to have an improved rate and possibly also extent of absorption due to its water solubility which is one important factor positively influencing bioavailability\u2014in particular when combined with its small particle size and large specific surface area as described in detail below. This is especially important with posaconazole, because it is a highly lipophilic base (log P>3, pKa 3.6 and 4.6).\nCrystalline form IV is stable under storage conditions which are typical for pharmaceutical compositions and is thus suitable for the preparation of medicaments. Typical storage conditions are, for example, storage at ambient temperature, such as about 20\u00b0 C. to about 30\u00b0 C., for several months (e.g., for at least 5 months, preferably at least 12 months, more preferably at least 24 months) in a closed vial.\nIn experiments crystalline form IV was stable during storage for 63 days at ambient temperature. Even when stored for 4 weeks at 40\u00b0 C., crystalline form IV was stable.\nIn this context, \u201cstable\u201d means that neither degradation nor polymorphic conversion to another polymorphic form of crystalline form IV can be detected, for example by HPLC, IR or XRPD analysis as defined herein.\nEven if suspended in water and stirred for 1 week at ambient temperature, crystalline form IV of posaconazole is not susceptible to transformation into another form.\nMoreover, if suspended in a pharmaceutical composition such as an aqueous suspension as herein described, and stirred for 1 week at ambient temperature, crystalline form IV of posaconazole shows polymorphic stability in the sense that no conversion to another polymorphic form is observed by measuring the X-ray Powder Diffraction Pattern as herein described (see also Example 6).\nCrystalline form IV of posaconazole consists of a large amount of a very fine fraction of rod-shaped particles with typical dimensions of 0.1-0.2 \u03bcm and a fraction of bigger and also rod-shaped crystals with about 0.3 \u03bcm thickness and a length of about 2-6 \u03bcm. A typical picture of crystals of form IV of posaconazole is seen in FIG. 5 showing a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) picture as obtained by low vacuum scanning electron microscopy, (pressure: about 8 Pa, backscattered electron detector, 20 kV electron acceleration voltage) from crystalline form IV of posaconazole as prepared according to the method of Example 4.\nThe specific surface area of crystalline form IV of posaconazole as such, i.e. as obtained according to the herein described methods, is typically about 10-25 m2/g\u00b10.5 m2/g, e.g. about 13-20 m2/g\u00b10.5 m2/g, such as about 15-17 m2/g\u00b10.5 m2/g, as measured according to the known Multi-Point-BET-method as herein described and as shown in Example 7. This specific surface area of crystalline form IV of posaconazole is about 10-fold larger when compared to that of known crystalline form I. It is known that the specific surface area between a solid and a liquid phase has a direct impact on the dissolution rate and thus on the bioavailability of the pharmaceutical ingredient as described e.g. by the equation by Nernst and Brunner as found in W. Nernst, Z. Phys. Chem. 47 (1904), pp. 52-55. Therefore, as a higher specific surface area value results in a higher dissolution rate, crystalline form IV of posaconazole is expected to exhibit a better dissolution behaviour and consequently a better bioavailability when compared to crystalline form I. Indeed, Example 9 and FIG. 6 show that crystalline form IV of posaconazole as such, i.e. in its non-micronized form\u2014when contained in a suspension\u2014shows a faster dissolution when compared to non-micronized form I. Moreover, non-micronized crystalline form IV of posaconazole shows even a slightly faster dissolution when compared to micronized form I. This improved dissolution behaviour is also shown in FIG. 6. Thus, crystalline form IV of posaconazole may advantageously be used as such, i.e. without being micronized, for preparing a pharmaceutical composition, e.g. a liquid suspension or dispersion as herein described\u2014in contrast to known posaconazole forms which are micronized for use in such suspensions as e.g. described in WO 02/80678.\nCrystalline form IV of posaconazole can be used as a medicament to treat or prevent any of the disorders which can be treated or prevented by posaconazole. In particular, crystalline form IV can be used for treating or preventing fungal infections, especially in mammals, such as humans. Thus, a method of treating or preventing a fungal infection by administering a therapeutically effective amount of crystalline form IV of posaconazole to a patient in need thereof is also contemplated. Crystalline form IV is suitable for treating or preventing a wide range of infections caused by fungal pathogens, including yeasts, dermatophytes and molds. Typical fungal infections which can be treated or prevented are those caused by Aspergillus, Blastomyces, Candida, Cryptococcus, Coccidioides, Epidermophyton, Fonsecaea, Fusarium, Mucor, Saccharomyces, Torulopsis, Trichophyton, Trichosporon, Sporothrix and Pneumocysitis, particularly Candida and Aspergillus.  \nTypical fungal infections which can be treated or prevented are invasive infections, which most often occur in immunocompromised patients, such as organ transplant patients, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and patients with hematologic malignancies with prolonged neutropenia from chemotherapy. Examples of fungal infections which can be treated or prevented are oropharyngeal candidiasis, including oropharyngeal candidiasis refractory to itraconazole and/or fluconazole, fusariosis, chromoblastomycosis, mycetoma, and coccidioidomycosis and invasive aspergillosis refractory to amphotericin B or itraconazole.\nThe crystalline form IV of posaconazole may thus be used for the preparation of a medicament for treating or preventing a fungal infection.\nUsually most of the posaconazole present in the pharmaceutical composition will be crystalline form IV although certain amounts of other crystalline forms or of amorphous posaconazole can also be present. Preferably at least about 90 wt.-%, more preferably at least about 95 wt.-%, and most preferably at least about 98 wt.-% of the posaconazole present in the pharmaceutical composition is crystalline form IV.\nCrystalline form IV of posaconazole can be administered alone or in combination with other pharmaceutically active compounds such as a further antifungal agent. In this case, the crystalline form IV of posaconazole and the other pharmaceutically active compound can be administered either simultaneously or sequentially.\nThe pharmaceutical composition comprising the crystalline form IV is not particularly limited and it can be formulated according to known principles, e.g. either alone or together with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable additive.\nCrystalline form IV of posaconazole can be administered according to any appropriate route. Typically, the pharmaceutical composition will be adapted for oral, parenteral (SC, IM, IV and IP), topical or vaginal administration or administration by inhalation (orally or intranasally), preferably for oral, parenteral or topical administration.\nDosage forms for oral administration include tablets, capsules, lozenges, pills, wafers, granules, oral liquids such as syrups, suspensions, dispersions, solutions, emulsions, cachets, powders and powders for reconstitution.\nDosage forms for parenteral administration include solutions or emulsions for infusion, solutions, suspensions, dispersions or emulsions for injection, pre-filled syringes, and/or powders for reconstitution.\nDosage forms for local/topical administration comprise insufflations, aerosols, metered aerosols, transdermal therapeutic systems, medicated patches, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, lotions, creams or ointments suitable for application to the skin, rectal suppositories, and/or ovula.\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be produced in a manner known per se to the skilled person as described, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 15th Ed., Mack Publishing Co., New Jersey (1991).\nPharmaceutical compositions according to the invention contain crystalline form IV as the active ingredient and optionally at least one pharmaceutically acceptable additive. Any pharmaceutically acceptable additive can be employed as long as it does not detrimentally affect the properties of the pharmaceutical composition. Examples of typical pharmaceutically acceptable additives comprise carriers (e.g., solid carriers such as magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethyl-cellulose and wax; or liquid carriers such as water, aqueous or less preferably non-aqueous liquids), vehicles, diluents, solvents, binders, adjuvants, solubilizers, thickening agents, stabilizers, disintegrants, glidants, lubricating agents, buffering agents, emulsifiers, wetting agents, suspending agents, sweetening agents, colorants, flavors, coating agents, preservatives, antioxidants, processing agents, drug delivery modifiers, additives to make solutions isotonic, antifoaming agents, encapsulating material, surfactants (particularly non-ionic surfactants), opacifying agents, enhancers, waxes, cap anti-locking agents (e.g. glycerol) and ion exchange resins.\nOther suitable pharmaceutically acceptable additives are described e.g. in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 15th Ed., Mack Publishing Co., New Jersey (1991).\nThe pharmaceutical composition may be a solid or liquid. Solid compositions include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets, and suppositories. In this embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable additive can be one or more substances mentioned above and particularly be selected from carriers, diluents, flavoring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders or disintegrants. In powders, the additive can be a finely divided solid which is in admixture with the finely divided active compound. Suitable solid carriers are well-known in the art and include magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethyl-cellulose and wax.\nThe pharmaceutically acceptable additive can also be an encapsulating material. The term \u201ccomposition\u201d is intended to include the formulation of the active ingredient with encapsulating material providing a capsule in which the active ingredient (with or without other additives) is surrounded by an encapsulating material, which is thus in association with it. Similarly, cachets are included. Tablets, powders, cachets and capsules can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration.\nTopical formulations containing crystalline form IV normally contain one or more non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable topical carriers and may be in the form of, e.g., a solution, suspension, emulsion, lotion, cream or ointment which is suitable for application to the skin of a mammal, in particular of a human patient. Topical formulations containing crystalline form IV which can be useful for nasal or ophthalmic administration are also contemplated. Ophthalmic formulations may also be ointments.\nTypical formulations and indications for posaconazole are described, for example, in WO95/17407, WO96/38443, WO02/80678, WO2005/117831, WO99/18097, U.S. Pat. No. 5,972,381, U.S. Pat. No. 5,834,472, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,957,730. It is to be noted that these patents and patent applications are given as an example only and that this list is not exhaustive.\nDue to its water solubility, in particular in combination with its large specific surface area and its small particle size as herein described, crystalline form IV is especially suitable for liquid pharmaceutical formulations, in particular for oral administration such as suspensions or dispersions, e.g. aqueous suspensions or dispersions.\nAqueous suspensions or dispersions of crystalline form IV of posaconazole are particularly stable and thus crystalline form IV is especially useful in the preparation of oral suspensions or dispersions.\nIn one preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is in the form of an aqueous suspension or dispersion comprising crystalline form IV of posaconazole and a non-ionic surfactant and optionally at least one thickening agent. Examples of non-ionic surfactants and thickening agents are disclosed in WO 02/80678. As these thickening agents facilitate suspension of the pharmaceutical composition, they may also be considered as suspending agents. The pharmaceutical composition may also optionally contain further additives as mentioned herein and/or known for formulating liquid forms such as antifoaming agents, preservatives, opacifying agents, flavors, sweeteners, diluents, cap anti-locking agents and buffering agents. This pharmaceutical composition is preferably suitable for oral administration. Thus, in one specific embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is an aqueous suspension or dispersion suitable for oral use which can be made by suspending or dispersing crystalline form IV of posaconazole (preferably having a particle size of less than about 100 \u03bcm, more preferably less than about 10 \u03bcm, even more preferably less than about 5 \u03bcm, most preferably having a size of about 1.5\u00b1about 0.5 \u03bcm or less than about 1.5\u00b1 about 0.5 \u03bcm), a non-ionic surfactant (such as a sorbitan ester), and optionally at least one thickening agent (e.g. a combination of xanthan gum and a liquid sugar) in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier (such as purified water).\nThe median particle size of crystalline form IV of posaconazole when used as such, i.e. in a non-micronized form for preparing a pharmaceutical composition in the form of a liquid suspension or dispersion as herein described, has been determined in samples taken from such suspension. Said median particle size is typically about 0.1-0.2 \u03bcm\u00b10.05 \u03bcm, e.g. 0.14-0.17 \u03bcm, such as 0.15 \u03bcm, when measured with known laser diffraction methods, e.g. determination of the particle size distribution (Malvern) according to the US-Pharmacopeia (USP) 32 (2009) method <429> and to the European Pharmacopeia (EP) 6 (2008) method 2.9.31. based on the diffraction of laser by particles within the measurement volume (for details see Example 8). In the present invention, the term median particle size is understood to mean the d(0.5) value as determined according to the herein described laser diffraction methods.\nTherefore and surprisingly, crystalline form IV of posaconazole as such\u2014i.e. in its non-micronized form\u2014shows a considerably smaller median particle size when compared to non-micronized known posaconazole polymorphic forms such as form I. Moreover, non-micronized crystalline form IV of posaconazole shows even a smaller median particle size than micronized form I, e.g. as contained in NOXAFIL\u00ae (US product, as available from Medizone Germany GMBH) as is demonstrated in Example 8.\nThis smaller particle size of crystalline form IV of posaconazole\u2014in particular in combination with its higher specific surface area value\u2014advantageously leads to an improved dissolution behaviour of crystalline form IV of posaconazole, e.g. when contained in a pharmaceutical composition such as a liquid suspension or dispersion. FIG. 6 and Example 9 demonstrate that said smaller particle size of crystalline form IV of posaconazole when contained in an aqueous suspension\u2014in particular in combination with said higher specific surface area value\u2014indeed leads to a distinctly faster dissolution when compared to non-micronized crystalline form I, and to a similar or even slightly faster dissolution when compared to micronized form I. As an improved dissolution behaviour is considered to enhance bioavailability, non-micronized crystalline form IV is expected to have an improved bioavailability as compared to that of non-micronized form I\u2014and a similar and probably slightly better bioavailability as compared to that of micronized form I as contained in known posaconazole suspensions.\nIndeed, it is known that for enhancing bioavailability, the particle size of known posaconazole forms\u2014when used for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition, e.g. for preparation of a suspension\u2014is generally reduced e.g. by micronization in order to obtain a mean particle size range of about 1000 nm to about 1800 nm, e.g. about 1200 nm to about 1600 nm, preferably of 1400 nm, or a median particle size of about 1.4\u00b10.2 \u03bcm as described in WO 02/80678. According to WO 02/80678, the preferred method for micronizing posaconazole is microfluidization, e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,533,254 which is a complex, time consuming and costly technique.\nIn contrast to known posaconazole forms such as crystalline form I as contained in known suspensions, e.g. NOXAFIL\u00ae, crystalline form IV of posaconazole may advantageously be used for the preparation of the herein described pharmaceutical compositions, e.g. suspensions or dispersions, without the need to be micronized. Thus, the use of crystalline form IV of posaconazole for preparing the above mentioned pharmaceutical compositions avoids any such costly and time consuming micronization techniques as herein mentioned. In other words, when using crystalline form IV of posaconazole as starting material for preparing pharmaceutical compositions, e.g. a liquid suspension or dispersion, advantageously there is no need to reduce its particle size, i.e. the particle size of its crystals, e.g. by conventional micronization techniques such as microfluidization or milling, before or during the manufacture of said composition. As a consequence, complex particle size monitoring procedures required during such laborious micronization steps are avoided. Additionally, the use of crystalline form IV of posaconazole for preparing these compositions reduces the number of steps of particle size control required throughout the manufacturing process, firstly because no such control is necessary for crystalline form IV as such, i.e. as used before starting the first step of said manufacturing process, and secondly because the above mentioned particle size monitoring steps necessitated during micronization are not required.\nTherefore, crystalline form IV of posaconazole may be used in a non-micronized form, e.g. having a median particle size of about 0.1-0.2 \u03bcm\u00b10.05 \u03bcm for the preparation of a medicament, e.g. a pharmaceutical composition, e.g. a suspension or dispersion, such as an aqueous suspension or dispersion, for treating or preventing a fungal infection.\nOptionally, and if ever potentially desired, crystalline form IV of posaconazole is advantageously also suitable for particle size reduction by conventional techniques such as micronization or milling techniques.\nOne specific example of a pharmaceutical composition in the form of a liquid suspension within the scope of the invention is described below:\nExample A\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \nIngredient\nConcentration in mg/ml\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \nPosaconazole Form IV\n40\n\n\n \nPolysorbate 80\n10\n\n\n \nSodium Citrate Dihydrate\n0.6\n\n\n \nCitric Acid Monohydrate\n1.5\n\n\n \nSimethicone\n3\n\n\n \nXanthan Gum\n3\n\n\n \nSodium Benzoate\n2\n\n\n \nLiquid Glucose\n350\n\n\n \nGlycerol\n100\n\n\n \nArtificial Cherry Flavour\n5\n\n\n \nTitanium Dioxide\n4\n\n\n \nPurified Water, q.s.\nAd 1 ml\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA suspension such as that of Example A may be prepared as follows:\nabout 40% of the final amount of Polysorbat 80 and about 40% of the final amount of Simethicone are mixed and dissolved and/or dispersed in about 12% of the final amount of purified water and homogenized with Ultra Turrax (as commercially available from IKA Werke GmbH, Germany). Subsequently, crystalline form IV of posaconazole is suspended or dispersed in this mixture under homogenization by Ultra Turrax. The remaining about 60% of Polysorbat 80 and of simethicone and about 32% of the final amount of the purified water are added and mixed and optionally homogenized using Ultra Turrax, followed by the addition of sodium benzoate, sodium citrate dihydrate and citric acid monohydrate. After further mixing, xanthan gum is added followed by mixing, e.g. by magnetic stirring, and a hydratization phase without any mixing. Subsequently, glycerol, liquid glucose and titanium dioxide are added under continuous mixing optionally using additionally a suitable homogenizer. Finally, cherry flavour and the remaining portion of about 56% of the final amount of purified water are added and mixed until a uniform suspension is obtained.\nIn one preferred embodiment, crystalline form IV of posaconazole is non-micronized, i.e. it has a median particle size of about 0.1-0.2 \u03bcm\u00b10.05 \u03bcm when used in the above described composition.\nIn another embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is in a solid form, e.g., in the form of a powder or of granules, which might be used to prepare a liquid form, such as a suspension or dispersion as described herein.\nParenteral forms to be injected intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously may generally be in the form of a sterile solution, and may contain additives such as salts or glucose to make the solution isotonic.\nThe dosage of crystalline form IV of posaconazole can be determined by a skilled physician and will depend on various factors such as the disorder to be treated, its severity, the mode of administration, the sex, age and weight of the patient, etc. Typically about 1 to about 30 mg/kg body weight per day, more typically about 1 to about 20 mg/kg body weight per day, even more typically about 1 to about 10 mg/kg body weight per day will be given for oral administration, while from about 0.25 mg/kg body weight per day to about 20 mg/kg body weight per day, preferably from about 0.5 mg/kg body weight per day to about 10 mg/kg body weight per day, will be applied via parenteral administration.\nThe amount of crystalline form IV within topical formulations can vary. It will typically be from about 0.1% to about 20%, preferably about 0.5% to about 10%, by weight of the total pharmaceutical composition.\nThe amount of crystalline form IV of posaconazole within the liquid pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration described above can also vary. It may be from about 10 mg/ml to about 100 mg/ml, preferably from about 20 mg/ml to about 60 mg/ml, and e.g. be about 40 mg/ml.\nAntifungally effective amounts of the liquid pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration described above and containing e.g. 40 mg/ml of crystalline form IV of posaconazole may be administered orally in doses of 5 ml containing 200 mg of crystalline form IV of posaconazole\u2014three times a day or four times a day\u2014, or in doses of 10 ml containing 400 mg of crystalline form IV of posaconazole\u2014twice a day. The attending physician may change the doses and dosing regimen in view of the age, health and sex of the patient as well as the severity of the disease.\nThe pharmaceutical compositions will be typically administered daily.\nThe present invention is illustrated by the following examples, which should not be construed as limiting.\nEXAMPLES\nThe X-ray powder diffraction pattern (XRPD) was obtained with a PANalytical X'Pert PRO diffractometer equipped with a theta/theta coupled goniometer in transmission geometry, Cu\u2014K\u03b11,2 radiation (wavelength 0.15419 nm) with a focusing mirror and a solid state PIXcel detector. The patterns were recorded at a tube voltage of 40 kV, tube current of 40 mA, applying a stepsize of 0.007\u00b0 2\u03b8 with 80 s per step (255 channels) in the angular range of 2\u00b0 to 40\u00b0 2\u03b8 at ambient conditions. A typical precision of the 2-theta values is in the range of about \u00b10.2\u00b0 2-theta. Thus a diffraction peak that appears at 5.0\u00b0 2-theta can appear between 4.8 and 5.2\u00b0 2-theta on most X-ray diffractometers under standard conditions.\nInfrared spectra (IR) were collected on a MKII Golden Gate\u2122 Single Reflection Diamond ATR (attenuated total reflection) cell with a Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR spectrometer with 4 cm\u22121 resolution. To collect a spectrum a spatula tip of a sample was applied to the surface of the diamond in powder form. Then the sample was pressed onto the diamond with a sapphire anvil and the spectrum was recorded. A spectrum of the clean diamond was used as background spectrum. A typical precision of the wavenumber values is in the range of about \u00b12 cm\u22121. Thus, an infrared peak that appears at 1716 cm\u22121 can appear between 1714 and 1718 cm\u22121 on most infrared spectrometers under standard conditions.\nDifferential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed with a DSC 7 (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, Conn., USA) using the Pyris software. A sample of about 4 mg was weighed into a 25 \u03bcl Al-pan.\nDry nitrogen was used as the purge gas (purge: 20 ml min\u22121). When used herein, the term \u201cTonset\u201d determined by Differential Scanning calorimetry means the temperature corresponding to the intersection of the pretransition baseline with the extrapolated leading edge of the transition.\nThermogravimetric analysis was performed with the thermogravimetric system TGA-7 using the Pyris Software for Windows NT (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, Conn., USA), 50 \u03bcl platinum pans, nitrogen purge gas (sample purge: 20 ml min\u22121, balance purge: 40 ml min\u22121).\nMelting points were determined with a B\u00fcchi B-545 instrument in automatic mode with a threshold of 40% transmission. Measurements were conducted in pharmacopeia mode at 1.0\u00b0 C./min heating rate.\nThe moisture sorption isotherm was recorded with a SPS-11 moisture sorption analyzer (MD Mess-technik, Ulm, D). The measurement cycle was started at 0% relative humidity (RH), increased in 10% steps up to 90% RH and in a 5% step up to 95% RH. The equilibrium condition for each step was set to a constant mass\u00b10.003% over 49 min. The temperature was 25\u00b10.1\u00b0 C.\nHPLC assay was performed using the following conditions:\n  Column: ZORBAX XDB-C18 Rapid Resolution HT, 1.8 \u03bcm, 50\u00d74.6 mm (Agilent Technologies) Eluent A: Dilute 2 ml of acetic acid (99-100%) with water and fill up to 1000 ml with water.

The mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 6 days. The white suspension was filtered and the product was dried in vacuum overnight to yield 240 mg of a white crystalline solid. The product was analyzed by DSC, FT-IR using an attenuated total reflectance cell as herein described and XRPD and found to be a novel form of posaconazole denominated as form IV.\nThe melting point of the product of Example 1 was 170.1\u00b10.5\u00b0 C.\nCrystalline form IV obtained according to example 1 has an X-ray powder diffraction spectrum as shown in FIG. 1.

As can be seen in FIG. 3 (lower curve), crystalline form IV shows a significant dehydration endotherm between 25\u00b0 C. and 105\u00b0 C. with a subsequent endothermic conversion at 116\u00b0 C. (Tonset 113.3\u00b0 C.) followed by a peak at 119.6\u00b0 C. (Tonset 117.5\u00b0 C.) and melting at 170.5\u00b0 C. with a Tonset of 167.9\u00b0 C. (10\u00b0 C./minute, open pan).\nThe water content of the obtained crystalline form IV was 2.43%. The moisture sorption isotherm of crystalline form IV shows a distinct step over 0.6 mol water uptake/loss between 0 and 10% relative humidity. The maximum water content peaks at 3.7% at 90% relative humidity, which corresponds to a water mol ratio of 1.5 (FIG. 4).\nExample 2\n500 mg of posaconazole form III, prepared by the method of example 6 described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,958,337, were suspended in a solution consisting of 10 ml of water and 2.5 ml of methanol. The mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 3 days. The white suspension was filtered and the product was dried in vacuum overnight. The product was analyzed by XRPD and found to be a mixture of form III and IV. The mixture of the two forms was again suspended in a solution consisting of 10 ml of water and 2.5 ml of methanol and stirred at ambient temperature overnight. Afterwards the solid was filtered off and dried in vacuum overnight to yield pure crystalline form IV of posaconazole.\nExample 3\n54 mg of posaconazole form III, prepared by the method of example 6 described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,958,337, were suspended in 2 ml water and seeded with form IV. The mixture was stirred at 25\u00b0 C. for 48 hours. The white suspension was filtered and dried in air to yield 38 mg of form IV.\nExample 4\n250 mg of posaconazole form III, prepared by the method of example 6 described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,958,337, were suspended in a solution consisting of 5 ml of water and 1.25 ml of methanol. After seeding with a form IV crystal, obtained by the method of example 2 above, the obtained mixture was stirred at about 50\u00b0 C. for 3 hours. The mixture was then cooled down to ambient temperature and the solid was collected by filtration and dried in vacuum at ambient temperature overnight yielding 245 mg of substantially pure form IV of posaconazole. The product was again suspended in a solution consisting of 5 ml of water and 1.25 ml of methanol and then stirred at ambient temperature overnight. The white solid was filtered off and dried in vacuum overnight to yield 240 mg of crystalline form IV.\nExample 5\nThe solubility of crystalline form IV was determined by the equilibrium solubility method. A saturated solution of form IV, obtained by stirring 250 mg form IV in 6 ml water overnight, was prepared. The sample was filtered through a 0.45 \u03bcm membrane filter and the concentration of form IV in the filtrate was measured using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 35 UV/VIS spectrophotometer (\u03bb=260 nm). The solubility of form IV was found to be 2.1 \u03bcg/ml which is more than two times higher than that of form I.\nExample 6\nThe stability of form IV in an aqueous pharmaceutical composition was investigated. 240 mg form IV were suspended in a 4 ml aqueous suspension consisting of a mixture of 19 mg sodium benzoate, 3 mg citric acid, 19 mg xanthan gum, 60 mg Polysorbat 80, 600 mg glycerine and 2 g liquid glucose. The suspension was stirred at ambient temperature for 1 week. Crystalline form IV remained stable in the suspension and no other form could be detected by XRPD.\nExample 7\nDetermination of the Specific Surface Area of Crystalline Form IV\nSpecific surface area measurement was performed with the equipment NOVA 2000 as commercially available from Quantachrome Instruments using the BET method and Nitrogen as the absorbed gas at 77\u00b0 K (i.e. \u2212196.15\u00b0 C.) as described e.g. by Medema J, Campagne A.: A Simple Method to Determine Cumulative Surface-Area Distributions of Porous Solids; Journal of Catalysis, Volume 8, Issue 2, pp. 120, 1967. Crystalline form IV of posaconazole was prepared according to Example 4. Crystalline form I was prepared by the method of example 3 described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,958,337. The results are shown in Table 2 below:\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSpecific Surface Area (in m2/g)\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \nCrystalline Form IV\nCrystalline Form I\n\n\n \nof posaconazole\nof posaconazole\n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n15.5\n1.5\n\n\n \n15.7\n1.6\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2 shows that crystalline form IV of posaconazole has an about 10-fold larger specific surface area when compared to crystalline form I of posaconazole. As explained above, this higher specific surface area value results in a higher dissolution rate which is expected to lead to an improved bioavailability of form IV when compared to that of known form I.\nExample 8\nDetermination of Median Particle Size of Form IV\nCrystalline form IV as obtained by Example 4 was used to prepare 25 ml of a suspension as follows:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \nIngredient\nQuantity (in g)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \nPosaconazole Form IV\n1.000\n\n\n \nPolysorbate 80\n0.250\n\n\n \nSimethicone\n0.075\n\n\n \nXanthan Gum\n0.075\n\n\n \nSodium Benzoate\n0.050\n\n\n \nSodium Citrate Dihydrate\n0.015\n\n\n \nCitric Acid Monohydrate\n0.038\n\n\n \nLiquid Glucose\n8.750\n\n\n \nGlycerol\n2.500\n\n\n \nTitanium Dioxide\n0.100\n\n\n \nPurified Water\n12.148\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe suspension was prepared as follows: 40% of the final amount of Polysorbat 80 and 40% of the final amount of simethicone were mixed and dissolved and/or dispersed in about 12% of the final amount of purified water and homogenized with Ultra Turrax (30 seconds; 27,000 rpm). Subsequently, 1 g of the form IV of posaconazole, i.e. in its non-micronized form, were suspended or dispersed in this mixture under homogenization by Ultra Turrax (27,000 rpm, 2 minutes). The remaining 60% of Polysorbat 80 and of simethicone and 32% of the final amount of the purified water were added and mixed followed by the addition of sodium benzoate, sodium citrate dihydrate and citric acid monohydrate. After further mixing, xanthan gum was added to the mixture under stirring, followed by a 30 minutes phase of hydratization without mixing. Subsequently, glycerol and liquid glucose as well as titanium dioxide and the remaining portion of 56% of the final amount of purified water were added under mixing with a suitable homogenizer until a uniform suspension was obtained.\n25 ml of a similar suspension were prepared analogously using non-micronized crystalline form I of posaconazole which was prepared by the method of example 3 described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,958,337.\nAdditionally, NOXAFIL\u00ae oral suspension (40 mg/ml) as commercially available from Medizone Germany GMBH (US product) was used to determine the particle size distribution of micronized form I of posaconazole which was contained in this known suspension.\nThe particle size distribution (Malvern) was measured according to the USP 32 (2009) method <429> and EP 6 (2008) method 2.9.31. based on the diffraction of laser by particles using a Mastersizer 2000S liquid dispersion system. The particle size measurement was started after ultrasonic treatment of the sample for 5 min. The results are shown in Table 3 below:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \nTABLE 3\n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \nMedian particle size\n\n\n \nPolymorphic form of posaconazole\n(d (0.5)-value in \u03bcm)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \nCrystalline Form IV (non-micronized)\n0.15\n\n\n \nCrystalline Form I (non-micronized)\n12.88\n\n\n \nCrystalline Form I (micronized as\n2.06\n\n\n \ncontained in NOXAFIL\u2009\u00ae)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3 shows that non-micronized crystalline form IV has an about 90-fold smaller median particle size when compared to non-micronized form I. Also, polymorphic form IV of posaconazole has an about 10-fold smaller median particle size when compared to micronized form I. This smaller particle size of crystalline form IV contributes to an improved dissolution behaviour of form IV, i.e. to a faster dissolution of form IV when compared to form I as is described in Example 9 below and shown in FIG. 6.\nExample 9\nDissolution of Crystalline Form IV as Compared to Crystalline Form I\nThe liquid suspensions containing non-micronized crystalline form IV or non-micronized crystalline form I as well as the NOXAFIL\u00ae oral suspension containing micronized crystalline form I described in Example 8 were tested for their dissolution behaviour.\nDissolution was tested according to USP 32 (2009) method <711> (USP apparatus II (Paddle); 25 rpm; dissolution medium: 0.3% SLS aqueous solution). Posaconazole concentrations were determined with an online photometer (UV absorption at 260 nm).\nThe results are shown in Table 4 below wherein values are the amount of posaconazole dissolved in %, and in more detail in FIG. 6 wherein the amount of posaconazole dissolved in % is plotted versus time in minutes.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n \n\n\nTime\nCrystalline Form IV\nCrystalline Form I\nCrystalline Form I\n\n\n(min)\nnon-micronized\nnon-micronized\nmicronized\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n3\n\u200282%\n29%\n54%\n\n\n25\n100%\n61%\n92%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in Table 4 and in FIG. 6, non-micronized crystalline form IV of posaconazole shows a distinctly faster dissolution when compared to non-micronized crystalline form I. Crystalline form IV additionally shows a similar, i.e. slightly faster rate of dissolution when compared to micronized form I as contained in the commercialized NOXAFIL\u00ae oral suspension.\nAs an improved dissolution behaviour is considered to enhance bioavailability, non-micronized crystalline form IV is expected to have an improved bioavailability as compared to that of non-micronized form I\u2014and a similar and probably slightly better bioavailability as compared to that of micronized form I as contained in known posaconazole suspensions.",
